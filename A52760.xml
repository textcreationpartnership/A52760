            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OUR Lordſhip being look'd on as a Prince among Philoſophers and Phyſicians, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that though the Author of this Treatiſe hath no Intereſt in you, he conceives himſelf to have Relation enough to you by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to venture a fixing of his eye upon you, and to preſent himſelf in this Book before you, as a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Judg to determine whether he ought to be protected, or no, in this bold Attempt, to open the eyes of our little World touching <pb facs="tcp:48729:3"/> the State of Phyſick. It is not my Opinion only, That there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſetling it upon better Doctrines, Methods, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; nor have I ventured to write any thing to that purpoſe, meerly upon account of my own Reaſon (for, ſhould an Angel from Heaven ſpeak to ſome People upon his own word, he would hardly be believed); but others have in their Writings drop'd, here and there many paſſages to the purpoſe; and the Reaſons which I have offer'd, I ſuppoſe your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> will find here to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſeconded by the moſt Learned men in the World, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid little but what is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in their Language, which coſt me a great deal of pains to collect; And I was the more willing ſo to manage the Diſcourſe, becauſe I <pb facs="tcp:48729:3"/> had a mind to get countenance to my Deſign, from the Opinions and Determinations of others more able than my ſelf. Which being ſaid, truly <hi>(my Lord)</hi> I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what confident I have done the buſineſs that I aim'd at; and there wants nothing to compleat this Confidence, but the paſſing of your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> Judgment; which living Teſtimony if I obtain, after the many other, both dead and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ones, which I have cited in this Book, I ſhall take the greater pleaſure in the Atchievement: However, I ſhall have content, in regard I have a Thouſand Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, a Conſcience well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged in the Work, and a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage for that Cauſe able to bear the brunt of ten Thouſand Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Reproaches, if they come, inſtead of Reaſon, from ſuch Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
<pb facs="tcp:48729:4"/> as are contrary-minded. But, in recompence of ſuch a Reward from ſome, I know I ſhall have grateful Acknowledgments from others of true Learning and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, when they come hereafter to know my Name, which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I forbear to prefix at length; not that I am aſhamed of the
<hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,</hi> but to the end that when it is expoſed to publick Cenſure, men may paſs the clearer Judgment, without paſſion or partiality; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when Authors are known, ſome out of reſpect to the Perſons, others out of envy, are apt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, or to condemn.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> will therefore, I hope, excuſe this Anonymous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs; and if you meet with any acute Reflections upon the
<hi>Galenick</hi> way, I preſume they are no other than neceſſary for the awakning of <pb facs="tcp:48729:4"/> ſuch as ſilently reſt in an Opinion of its ſufficiency; for certainly, after a ſubduing of it by ſtrength of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſo many good Authorities, it is but juſt to act a little triumph over ſuch Perſons, who continually calumniate men that are not of their way, and are ſo confident, as to attempt an <hi>Autarchie</hi> in Phyſick, and long for an opportunity to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and trample upon the nobler ſort of Philoſophers and Phyſicians, and, if it were in their power, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to extinguiſh them; when as (to uſe a vulgar
<hi>Angliciſm)</hi> they are not worthy to be named the ſame day with them, for true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in the Art.</p>
            <p>I ſhall <hi>(my Lord)</hi> ſay little more from my ſelf, but end with the words of a worthy Member of the Colledg of Phyſicians (by name D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Bennet)</hi> not long ſince deceaſed, <pb facs="tcp:48729:5"/> in his Epiſtle to the Reader before his <hi>Theatri Tabidorum Veſtibulum; Let none ſpurn at me becauſe what I offer is of a new Production; for, I have by certitude of Obſervations, faithfully and ſuccinctly laid open the fallacy of ſome Opinions anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently received, and not taken Precepts upon truſt, only from Authors, for underſtanding the Conſtitution of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Moreover, I have not learn'd to go according to Vulgar Inſtitution, but have made bold to ſtep aſide out of the Common Road, being inclined to contemplate and reverence Nature, rather than her Apes.</hi> And his Book concludes, as I do this Epiſtle to your Lordſhip, thus: <hi>I would to God that Phyſitians would think of refining, correcting, and altering the Method of Phyſick, that it might be more accurately and efficaciouſly fitted to the ſcopes of Curation; in</hi> 
               <pb facs="tcp:48729:5"/> 
               <hi>order whereunto, a liberty of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſpeaking freely being firſt obtained, notwithſtanding the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of crabbed and moroſe old Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, I ſhall undertake, relying upon Experience, and being inſtructed by her, to publiſh and poſitively aſſert divers things, ſomwhat copiouſly and boldly, according to the nature of my Deſign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſhould not have been ſo bold here to talk at this rate before you, had not the words been put into my mouth by one whoſe Writing ſpeaks him to have been one of the freeſt and moſt ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the Doctors. And as to what concerns me, ſeeing I am at preſent concealed from your Lordſhip, let me give you this brief account of my ſelf; That the
<hi>Treatiſe</hi> is preſented to you by one that from his Youth hath been
<pb facs="tcp:48729:6"/> converſant in the Studies of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and came young to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of it in this great City, above twenty years ago; and after ſome years of forbearance, though nev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It was a liberty which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf took, by ſtrength of Reaſon, to judg and condemn the Opinions and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſuch as went before him, and frame a Body of Phyſick of his own: He may be called the Father of the <hi>Four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and of the Four Phantſies called

Let me tell them, as long as they are carried with this vain opinion of Authority, and ſo earneſtly yield up themſelves and their Followers Vaſſals to Authors, doubtleſs they do a great injury even to the Ancients themſelves, ſeeing it never enter'd into the minds of</hi> Hippocrates, Galen, Ariſtotle, <hi>or the other old Sages of Natural Science, to conſecrate their Works to Poſterity, with ſuch an intent as to count it neceſſary that men ſhould preſently be content with them only, and reſt wholly therein; but rather, that they ſhould remember to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their Endeavors to ſearch and proceed further, and produce ſomewhat of their own: For, as our Anceſtors did abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour to add to their own Inventions, with as great exactneſs as might be, to the Inventions of ſuch as went before them, and perform'd their utmoſt, by learned Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, to illuſtrate ſuch things as to them ſeemed difficult and obſcure; ſo it is our duty ſo to reverence the fair Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Inventions of good Authors, and ſo apply our ſelves to the Inventors, as an Inheritance belonging to many; and</hi>

               <p>Mens not being perſwaded of this, is the great occaſion of the little progreſs that hath been made in all other Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as well as that of Phyſick; and the incomparable Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> among the ſeveral Cauſes of the non-advancement of all manner of Sciences, reckons this for one, <hi>An extream Affection to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>

                  <hi>Indeed, to ſpeak truly,</hi> Antiquitas Seculi, Juventus Mundi;
<hi>Antiquity of Time is the Youth of the World. Certainly, our Times are the ancient Times, when the World is now ancient; and not thoſe which we count ancient,</hi> ordine retrogrado, <hi>by a computation backward from our own Times; and yet ſo much credit</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>hath been given to old Authors, as to inveſt them with the power of Dictators, that their words ſhould ſtand, rather than admit them as Conſuls to give Advice.</hi> And this kept Phyſick, till of late years, as well as other Sciences, low, at a ſtay, and very heartleſs, without any notable Growth or Advancement; and upon this account (as the ſame Lord ſaith) <hi>the Liberal Sciences have fared far worſe than the Arts Mechanical, which always have been, and are continually much improved;</hi> whereas in this of Phyſick and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, men have formerly thought it wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom not to budg an inch from the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the firſt Maſters; inſomuch that when <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> firſt came in play, the Profeſſors and Operators were thought to be Mad-men; but afterwards (when they gained ſome ground and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World) the
<hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> and <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48729:16"/> 
                  <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> ſeeing that reproach and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt would not do the work, began to raiſe a fierce perſecution, by ſtirring up Princes and Magiſtrates againſt them, as a pack of <hi>Magicians, Mountebanks, Rogues, Cheats, Vagabonds,</hi> and I know not what; and procured Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes to be made againſt them as ſuch, till the excellency of the Art it ſelf, and its grand Atchievements, opened the eyes of Governours, and ſtopp'd the mouths of gainſayers; and even the common people came to ſee, that it was the Intereſt of the Collegiate Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Phyſitians, who lived in eaſe and ſplendor, practiſing with old Maxims and Medicines, not to permit a new labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sect of Philoſophers, working Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg out of the Fire, by their Induſtry and Succeſſes, to bring a reproach upon them for their Idleneſs, and ſuperſtitious devotion to their old heatheniſh Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; of whom the ſame moſt excellent Lord and Philoſopher ſaith thus in his Preface,
<hi>I dare confidently avouch, that the Wiſdom we have extracted chiefly from the Grecians, ſeems to be a Child-hood of Knowledg, and to participate that which is proper to Children, namely, That it is</hi> 
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48729:16"/>
                  <hi>apt for Talk, but impotent and immature for Propagation; for, it is of Controverſies rank and fertile, but of Works barren and fruitleſs;</hi> the truth of which never ſo ſignally appears, as when two or three of the dogmatical Admirers of that Learning, and of the uſual Medicines, come at any time to meet in a Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; after which, if no good be done by them, it frequently comes to paſs, when all is deſperate, that ſome noble Medicine (lying without the Road of their Method, and a <hi>Pharmacopeia)</hi> which they may pleaſe to call Emperical, through the goodneſs of God performs a Cure; and yet he that adminiſtred it, be he otherwiſe never ſo Learned and Rational, if he be not a Drone of the old <hi>Methodical Hive,</hi> is ſure to be calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated, and mark'd with a black Coal, though themſelves only have deſerved it.</p>
               <p>Now this were a thing to be admired at, but that we find it hath always fared thus with the <hi>Beaux Eſprits,</hi> thoſe brave Spirits in all Ages, who have advanced Learning beyond the brains of Titular Doctors and Philoſophers, and above thoſe antiquated Notions which are the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48729:17"/> Idols of ſuch as are too proud and idle to go to School again to learn new; though I muſt tell them, 'Tis no ſhame for any to be a Learner in the School of Nature, whoſe Myſteries are ſublime, her Treaſures inexhauſtible; and he who will ſtudy, could he live (as
<hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith) a thouſand Ages, would even then find matter and occaſion for new Enquiry and Diſcovery<hi>:</hi> But the miſery is, that other ways have been taken by too many, though of late years they have been ſhamed out of it by the Induſtry of their <hi>Juniors.</hi>

                  <hi>Fernelius</hi> himſelf ſpake but lightly of Anatomy, and was <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48729:21"/> of opinion, our Brethren might better ſpend their time in making Obſervations on the Sick; to which give me leave to add an exhortation to labour with their own hands in amending, refining, invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and compounding of Medicines, that we may be delivered from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and terrour of thoſe many fulſom Compoſitions, borrowed from the Greeks and Arabians, who were Perſons in their Time to be applauded, and of ſuch ingenuity, that were they now liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee what improvement the Art hath received of late in a few years, would doubtleſs admire the dotage of thoſe men who live lazing upon the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Knowledg that comes by Tradition, and the Name they have acquired by Time, and timely courting of Women and Nurſes; and be the firſt in throwing moſt of their own old Medicines out of the Diſpenſatory and the Shops.</p>
               <p>I could inlarge on this ſubject by innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Inſtances, to ſhew how here, and in other Nations, thoſe worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have made it their buſineſs to advance the Profeſſion of Phyſick by new Inventions, and Principles, have <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48729:21"/> from time to time been unhandſomly treated, till Time and Experience taught others to approve and admire them. But you will ſay, To what end is all this Diſcourſe about theſe things? 'Tis only to plead for a freedom for ſuch as labour in the ſecrets of Nature, and that no diſcouragement be given to ſuch laborious and ingenious Inquirers, who have too long ſuffered under the imperious Cenſures of ſuch as partly by their Rules, partly by their courſe of Practiſe, would tie men to the old heavy Compounds, and by virtue of Seniority impoſe upon others, and dictate in all Meetings called Conſultations about the Sick; and, like the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> keep all others at a diſtance that are not of their own number or extraction; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, like the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperors, ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle all their Brethren, or thoſe that are too active to live under their Empire and Juriſdiction. The truth whereof, and the great Inconveniences thence likely to enſue, will the better appear, if I ſet before you two (omitting many other) very remarkable Inſtances, which I ſhall here give, becauſe the perſons concerned <pb n="20" facs="tcp:48729:22"/> in the Relation were men beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and renown'd for Phyſick in the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> and (like <hi>Auguſtus)</hi> did not only conquer all their Oppoſites, but out-live them, and all their ſlanders: The Perſons were, Sir <hi>Theodore de Mayern;</hi> and his Friend, the famous <hi>Quercetan:</hi> this latter known now by his Learned Works to all the World, and followed; the other not ſo known in print, becauſe his numerous Writings, Memorials, and Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (which have been ſufficiently talked of by ſuch as ſaw them) have not yet been publiſhed; but he was otherwiſe known to purpoſe in both Nations, for his many performances of Cure among the greateſt Princes and Perſons; yet theſe two Men, when they firſt began to ſhew themſelves at <hi>Paris,</hi> and went out of the ordinary Dog-road of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, felt a grievous ſtorm fall upon them from the then meer Galenick Dons of the Colledg of <hi>Paris,</hi> they having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd one of their own number to write a Book in Latine, the Title whereof in Engliſh is,

<hi>Turquet,</hi> yet becauſe (in French) it ſignifies a <hi>little dog,</hi> the witty Champion of the Colledg choſe rather to mention him by that Name, as a ſubject that would better ſerve (as he thought) for matter of quibble and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, though his Father was known to be a Gentleman of good Deſcent and Scholarſhip, and the Title <hi>de Mayern</hi> denoted a Lordſhip within the Territory of <hi>Geneva,</hi> which gave name to the Family.

               <p>It would be to little purpoſe for me to animadvert upon theſe dreadful Bulls, thundred out againſt two perſons of ſo great worth; let it ſerve for their juſtification, That, for all this, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer became famous in <hi>France,</hi> the Kings Phyſitian, and lived to ſee the Colledg repent of their folly, and their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors become Admirers of thoſe Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Books and Remedies which had been ſo raſhly damned. The other became Phyſitian to two Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and two of <hi>England,</hi> and left a Name of <pb n="27" facs="tcp:48729:25"/> great honour and wealth behind him. Only this is publiſhed, that it may ſerve for a warning to great perſons, and others, that they dote not in any Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too much upon the Names <hi>Doctor</hi> and <hi>Colledg,</hi> when Publick Good is at ſtake, ſeeing they may be deceived, and be apt to deceive others, if the like idle Spirit of Pride, Intereſt, and Envy, ſhould at any time poſſeſs them, to cry down Perſons and Things, which once in ſeven years themſelves may think fit to follow under-hand, and by ſtealth practiſe; but not be ſeen to do it, for fear of loſing their Credit. It may ſerve likewiſe to evince, That ſeeing men of greateſt Learning and Abilities in the Profeſſion, have judged the old Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and Phyſick inſufficient, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon receded from it. And whereas in this prying, laborious Age, wherein new diſcoveries of Medicine are every day wrought out of the Fire, and other ways, and more like to be diſcovered, for the benefit of man-kind, afflicted more than ever with monſtrous Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (ſuch as the ordinary Remedies of the Shops will not reach); and ſeeing, if <pb n="28" facs="tcp:48729:26"/> any Society of men be armed with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to regulate, cenſure, or ſuppreſs whom and what they pleaſe, the moſt ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Labourers muſt be left to the mercy of others leſs laborious, and be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, or condemned, as others have been before them, if it pleaſe the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Maſters: Therefore doubtleſs any rational man will be of opinion, That it is the concernment of Nations to admit a greater latitude in the Profeſſion and Practiſe of Philoſophy and Phyſick, than the Intereſt (and many times the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance) of ſome men of the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion would be willing to allow: Which was the thing I had a mind to ſhew.</p>

1661. and procured plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful excretions of Worms out of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of young and old, from Children to perſons of ſeventy years of Age; yea, and what I could hardly believe, when I firſt read the Obſervations of
<hi>Schen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kius,</hi> and others, I that year found very true in a young man and old woman, that Worms will make their own way into the World, through the Bowels and Sides of the perſons that breed them, and this without dammage, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being uſed but a little freſh Butter to the Orifice, to make all whole again. He is but a dull Practiſer that doth not yearly ſee Agues and Fevers appearing in new forms; and you may particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remember what the ſtate of thoſe Diſeaſes was in the Autumnal Quarter of the year 1657. and both the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Fall</hi> of the year 1658. and how wonderfully the Agues and Fevers vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that ſhort revolution of time; the ground of which marvellous change in <pb n="33" facs="tcp:48729:28"/> the World, both in reſpect of Agues, and other Diſeaſes, I may give you a full account of before the concluſion of this Treatiſe, and thereupon let you ſee cauſe to apprehend the uſefulneſs of what I now publiſh to the World, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover thoſe two ſecret Enemies which now run in a blood (more or leſs) through all the generations of Mankind, and have transform'd the whole Scene of Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>I might next inſiſt on ſeveral Diſeaſes of the Female Sex, grown more ſevere than they were in the days of their great Grandames, who, could they now riſe out of their Graves again, would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee the miſerable ſtate of poor Women, and the tyranny of thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers which were in their time leſs frequent, and more calm and curable, (for, the ſame Remedies now will do little good towards a Cure); but I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear particulars, ſeeing, for Modeſties ſake, they are not to be expoſed to every Reader.</p>
               <p>That the Diſeaſe called the <hi>French Pox</hi> is extraordinarily varied, appears by the account given of it at its firſt appearance <pb n="34" facs="tcp:48729:29"/> in the World, compared with what we ſee at this day. If you conſult <hi>Fracaſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and <hi>Benivenius,</hi> you will find, It, in the beginning brake forth in odious Puſtles of ſeveral kinds upon the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Head, the Face, the Neck, the Breſt, the Arms, and generally the whole Body. Some alſo it disfigured after the rate of a Leproſie; others had a kind of ſcurf, which ſcaling off, diſcover'd the skin underneath to be black or blew: Upon ſome, filthy ichorous ſores were continually running. And beſides all this, they had in the inward parts great tormenting Exulcerations, as in the Mouth, the Throat, the Noſtrils, the urinary and ſpermatick Paſſages, which did eat off the Yard, the Palate, the Lips, the Noſe, in deſpight of all Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; ſo that men being affected with the Diſeaſe, their Friends were frighted from looking upon them, and ſhunned them as if they had been viſited with the Peſtilence: Theſe things being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, with the horrid pains that rack'd them, it was rightly termed by a certain Author, <hi>Miſerabile Scortatorum Flagel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum; The miſerable Scourge of Whore-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:48729:29"/> But though it was thus with the Diſeaſe then, yet
<hi>Fernelius,</hi> who was born almoſt twenty years before it was diſcovered in <hi>Europe,</hi> and lived to ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two years of Age, ſaw it very much changed in the ſpace of thirty or fourty years, inſomuch that he tells us, in his time it was much altered,

               <p>Another change likewiſe hath been made of this Diſeaſe, in that where one perſon gets this Diſeaſe by the beaſtlineſs of Venery, many hundreds have it by Traduction: For, it is moſt true which

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48729:30"/> it in my dayly Practiſe; foraſmuch as abundance of people grow ſickly, and languiſh under the appearance (it may be) of a Conſumption, a Gout, a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and Ague, a ſlow Fever, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an acute one, Sore-eyes, Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickneſs, and indeed of all manner of Diſeaſes, which (when the other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary means have been long uſed in vain) have at length been relieved by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly uſe of ſuch Anti-venereous Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as I have on purpoſe invented, the nature whereof is, to fight againſt Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours both great and ſmall, in old or young, which have been any way touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Venereal Tincture, either through their own default, or by ſigil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of thoſe ſeminal Principles, which contribute towards the Being of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in the Act of Generation; which whoſoever takes not into conſideration, in curing the Diſeaſes of this Age (now that the Families of Mankind are tinctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all, more or leſs) will miſs of his aim; and 'tis the main reaſon why ſo few are throughly cured, becauſe few Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans proceed upon an improvement of this Notion, or the inventing of ſuch <pb n="38" facs="tcp:48729:31"/> Remedies as are of a large reach, and properly conducing thereunto. But of this Subject I ſhall have occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more copiouſly ere long.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, let me have leave to inſiſt upon another ſore Evil under the Sun, called the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> which, like the former, is very much alter'd alſo from what it was in former days, and become every jot as Univerſal. I find it is a Diſeaſe of no very long ſtanding, much about the Age of its Couſin-german the <hi>Pox;</hi> for I have read, that when D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Dorp,</hi> a Divine of <hi>Lovain,</hi> (one much eſteemed by <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas More)</hi> was afflicted with it, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians of that Univerſity were amazed at it, as a new and unknown Diſeaſe; and not knowing what to do towards a Cure, he died under their hands: So that whatever others talk, and would fain reduce it to the old
<hi>Stomacace</hi> and <hi>Sceletyrbe, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Sore Mouth</hi> and
<hi>Sore Legs</hi> of <hi>Pliny,</hi> yet queſtionleſs 'tis but of a late ſtanding in the World; and of late years 'tis grown ſo much another thing, that 'tis in a manner wholly new. The Authors which write of it give this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48729:31"/> account, That at its firſt appearance it brake forth in Sores and ſtinking Ulcers in the Mouth and Legs, looſneſs and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of Teeth, rotting of the Gums, debility of Legs and all the Limbs, Spots of all Colours upon the Skin, acting very much of the ſame kind of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with Scabs, Scurffs, and Ulcers of a malignant nature, as the <hi>French Pox</hi> did, which were not to be cured by old uſual Remedies, but only by Specificks of a new invention. And as the <hi>Pox</hi> is ſaid to have been diſcovered at firſt among the French (which yet <hi>Rondele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48729:32"/> to Son, and is become hereditary; ſo that being as it were individually radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the very Principles of mens Bodies, it hath conſpired with the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalities of the <hi>Pox,</hi> and both have joyn'd their Malignant Forces, to bring a ſtrange <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> upon the whole Frame of Nature in Mankind, and all the diſeaſes thereto belonging: But of this I ſhall ſay more anon; In the <hi>interim,</hi> let it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to know, that it rambles about alſo in the habit of other diſtempers; ſo that if an odd-humor'd diſeaſe happen, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Phyſitian, if he will be dextrous in curing, to exerciſe his ſkill firſt in diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, whether ſuch a diſeaſe have in it a Tincture of the <hi>Pox,</hi> or the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> or both; and then ſecondly, to invent ſuch Remedies to have in readineſs, as may hit either of theſe; but certainly ſuch Remedies are beſt as have a power to ſtrike at both, becauſe (as <hi>Eugalenus</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> well obſerves) the Symptoms

<hi>Germany,</hi> in an Epiſtle of his to the Famous <hi>Horſtius,</hi> ſhews how the <hi>Scurvy</hi> altered, as it got footing and time; for, it was ſo much another thing in <hi>High Germany</hi> from what it had been in the <hi>Lower,</hi> and other Parts more <hi>North,</hi> that in his dayes it was <hi>hardly ſo much as a</hi>

                  <hi>ſhadow of what it had been among thoſe Northern Men,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Deſcription of <hi>Eugalenus, Wierus, Ronſeus, Foreſtus;</hi> yea, and of <hi>Platerus,</hi> who did but tranſcribe out of them what he writes of this Particular, though he deliver it as his own. The Inſtance is but ſhort, and 'tis taken out of the
<hi>Bils of Mortality,</hi> which ſhew both the increaſe of the
<hi>Scurvy,</hi> and the Malignity of it; for, if you look back on former dayes about 30 years agoe, the number reckoned to dye of that Diſeaſe was but ſmall, and year after year ever ſince it hath encreaſed gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. In the year 1630. the number <pb n="43" facs="tcp:48729:33"/> was but 5. In 1631.
7.—1632. 9.—1636. 25.—Afterward, in the year 1647. the Account came up to 32.—In the year 1652. to 43.—In 1655. to
44.—In 1656. to 103.—And in the years ever ſince, they are numbred ſometimes above 70, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times above 80, ſometimes above 90, which ſignifieth, that the Diſeaſe is very much alter'd, being grown to a higher pitch of Malignity and Mortality than in former time. But you are to conceive withall, that the numbers ſo ſet down were onely of ſuch as dyed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Tokens of the Scurvy, whereas many hundreds have dyed, and do die every year of Maladies, which radically and in the main are Scorbutick; yet becauſe they are not diſcernible by vulgar Phyſitians, and others, have their lot to be regiſtred under the Names of other Diſeaſes; as will be further made evident before I end this Chapter.</p>
               <p>My next Obſervation ſhall be of the <hi>Rickets,</hi> which is a Diſeaſe of a very late Original; for, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>John Graunt,</hi> an ingenious Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> who lately wrote an excellent ſhort Treatiſe <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48729:34"/> of Obſervations upon the <hi>Weekly Bils of Mortality,</hi> hath obſerved, that we find in them no Mention of
<hi>Rickets</hi> till the year 1634: which agrees much with the time of its Original, ſet down by the Learned
<note n="*" place="margin">De Rachitide.</note> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> who ſaith, it was diſcover'd firſt in the Weſt-parts of <hi>England, viz.</hi> in the Counties of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,</hi> and <hi>Somerſet,</hi> about 30 years agoe, from whence it ſoon found the way to <hi>London,</hi> from whence it is now ſpread through all parts of
<hi>England.</hi> About 20 or 25 years agoe, though it were a grievous diſeaſe, yet not what it is now; It manifeſted it ſelf by an over-growing of the Liver and Spleen, with a crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Legs, a bending in of the Hams, knotting of the Joynts, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growth of the Head, a ſinking of the Back-bone, a narrowneſs of the Cheſt, and a general failing of the ſtrength of all the Limbs: but in theſe dayes the Caſe is alter'd; ſometimes ſome of theſe Symptoms appear, but not ſo frequent as formerly, and theſe cannot be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the onely Pathognomical Signs of the diſeaſe, becauſe it alſo, as well as the <hi>Pox</hi> and
<hi>Scurvy,</hi> marcheth under <pb n="45" facs="tcp:48729:34"/> the Colours of moſt other diſeaſes; as the <hi>Hydrocephalus intra Cranium,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Water in the Head, difficulty of Teeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> the <hi>Aſthma,</hi> or
<hi>difficulty of Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Convulſion, Falling Sickneſs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, Hectick Fever, Malignant Fever, Slow Fever, Ague, Dropſie, Kings Evil,</hi> and many more at preſent, and more like to be hereafter, when it ſhall by Tract of time arrive to be hereditary, (as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be already) and joyn force with thoſe Enemies which are the Seminal Products of Venereous and Scorbutick Agents. However, the Diſeaſe is even ſo much changed both in Symptoms and the effects of them, that it doth more and more miſchief, by making greater deſtruction of Infants one year after an other: For, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Graunt</hi> hath ſhewn out of the yearly Bils, that the
<hi>Rickets</hi> were never more numerous than now, and they are like to encreaſe; for, in the year 1630. there dyed but 12 of it. In the year 1649. there dyed 190, the next year 260, next after that 329, and ſo forwards, with ſome little ſtarting backward in ſome years, until the year 1660, which produced the greateſt <pb n="46" facs="tcp:48729:35"/> number of all, <hi>viz.</hi> 521. which is a great Advance in ſo few years from Number 12. But it is not to be attributed onely to this, that the Diſeaſe is more ſpred abroad, but that it is alſo very much alter'd in its own Nature, to a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive condition: And being enter'd into a complication already with the <hi>Pox</hi> &amp; the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> (as

               <p>Next, let us note the <hi>Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> which in the Bils of Mortality ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be exceedingly encreaſed, far beyond the proportion of the numbers of Inhabitants which have been added to this great City, the truth whereof will be clear to any that will take pains to compare the Bils ſince the year 1629. <pb n="47" facs="tcp:48729:35"/> So that the extraordinary increaſe of this Malady muſt be attribured alſo to ſome other Cauſe than the increaſe of People; and what can that be, but the change of the Diſeaſe it ſelf to be of another nature than heretofore? For it (for the moſt part) contemns all thoſe large Pectoral Swils, long Syrups, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries, which were ſuppoſed to work wonders heretofore; the
<hi>Phthiſis</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of <hi>Phthiſis;</hi> the
<hi>Atrophie</hi> another kind of <hi>Atrophie;</hi> and the <hi>Hectick</hi> another manner of <hi>Hectick,</hi> than was in former dayes; and theſe three Species of a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption</hi> ſpring generally in this Age from one Root, which is in plain Terms no other but the <hi>Pox</hi> and
<hi>Scurvy,</hi> either Hereditary or Adventitious; and thoſe waſtings of the Body to a <hi>Sceleton,</hi> are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually the Effects and Monuments of their Treachery and Tyranny; ſo that he who will now a dayes cure a
<hi>Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> muſt ſtrike at the Root, as well as regard the Circumſtances, wherein little good is to be done likewiſe by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Anti-venereal Means and Courſes, foraſmuch as the uſual Decoctions, Sweatings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do rather exaſperate the Diſeaſe than militate againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:48729:36"/> From the ſame Root likewiſe moſt commonly ſprings that Diſeaſe, which the Vulgar calls a <hi>Stopping of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,</hi> and it advanceth to a height in the ſame manner, both as to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity wherewith it handles men and women, and the number which it kills: for, whereas it ſeems to be ſomewhat that is new, becauſe we hear no News of it in our <hi>Bils</hi> till the year 1636. (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Graunt</hi> reckons) and then but of 6. for that year, it in the year 1655. came to be

               <p>There is another Diſeaſe which the people term the

<hi>Stomack,</hi> and the <hi>Mother,</hi> will do little good in theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and that is the reaſon why ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Phyſicians are miſtaken in what they preſcribe, and ſo their Patients loſe both their Coſt and their Labour.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Convulſion</hi> alſo is a Diſeaſe now of another nature than formerly; In former years, it ſlew its half hundreds of children, now its many Hundreds in a year; for the Bils tell you that <hi>Anno</hi> 1629. there died but 52. which in 1636. grew to 709. keeping about that ſtay till
1659. though ſometimes riſing to about 1000, as the Eſtimate is made by the ſame ingenious Obſervator: to which I may add, that in the year 1662. they roſe to 1053. and in the year 1663. they fell back, and were only 1011. which great encreaſes cannot be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the encreaſe of children (who are <pb n="52" facs="tcp:48729:38"/> the parties moſt afflicted with it) becauſe the numbers of New Comers into the world are not advanced in any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable proportion to anſwer ſo great an Increaſe of the Mortality; but it muſt be aſcribed rather to the great Alteration of the Diſeaſe it ſelf, which requires other Notions to proceed by, and other things than old Methods and Means to cure this ſo general a Deſtroyer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Small Pox</hi> and <hi>Meaſels</hi> muſt not be judged by the Bils, as the reſt are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ſome years they become
<hi>epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and then the ſlaughter they make fals out (more or leſs) according to the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the particular ſeaſons: but the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation to be made of them is when they are <hi>ſporadical,</hi> here and there ſprinkled up and down among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in thoſe years which have not any ſuch general Malignity above other years; and then conſider, that as they ſeize but upon a few people, ſo of thoſe few there die many more, and thoſe of them that eſcape do much more hardly eſcape, than in former times, both thoſe Diſeaſes being attended with more dreadful and more dangerous <hi>Symptoms:</hi> 
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:48729:38"/> which being obvious to every Nurſe, it is needleſs to inſiſt further thereupon than to let you know, that moſt of thoſe which miſcarry, die partly for want of ſome more generous Remedies than the Shops yield; and partly through the inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency of Phyſitians, who do not calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their Preſcriptions to meet with that <hi>Seroſa Colluvies</hi> of Saline, and acid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, with which the blood of Man-kind (eſpecially in theſe North-parts of the world) is both by propagation and by intemperance of Diet and Luxury ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly tainted: the extraordinary active Fermentation and Ebullition whereof, when corrupted, is the Cauſe why <hi>Agues, Fevers, Small-Pox, Meaſels,</hi> and all that hath any thing of Fever in it, proves ſo difficult, or ſo deadly. In the dayes of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> and <hi>Meaſels</hi> were either alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unknown, or elſe ſo light and eaſie, that they were never reckoned as particular diſeaſes among the
<hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> but look't on as Accidents only, and Critical Eruptions ſupervening putrid and Malignant Fevers: And in after-time we hear no ſuch News of <pb n="54" facs="tcp:48729:39"/> them, till the <hi>Arabians</hi> began to deſcribe the <hi>Small Pox</hi> as a Diſeaſe diſtinct from others; but then they were very gentle, and thus continued till about 40. years agoe, and leſs. Juſt ſo, <hi>Riverius</hi> tells us, it was in the
<hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> till the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> arrived there, and then it hapned that a <hi>Black Slave</hi> ſickning of the Small Pox with Peſtilential Symptoms, the maligne and venomous quality thereof being communicated by contagion to others, the Diſtemper began to rage at ſuch a height, that a great part of the <hi>Indians</hi> were deſtroyed by it, though ſo milde before, that it was not reputed worth the Trouble of Phyſick or Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</p>
               <p>I might ſwell a Diſcourſe up to a Volume, ſhould I inſiſt upon every Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; as the <hi>Arthritis Vaga Scorbutica,</hi> which being ſprung up of late years, a Conſequent of the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> is called by the people the <hi>Running Gout,</hi> and grows

               <p>THis Subject not having been hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to purpoſe by any that I know of, and there being but a ſhort hint given in the former Chapter, that the <hi>French Pox</hi> and the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> by their Invaſions made upon the Univerſality of Mankind, have been the two Main Cauſes of the Alteration; it will be worth the while to make a Scrutiny into the certainty of the thing.

<hi>John Wynel,</hi> whoſe deſign in writing was not ſo much to particulariſe the manner how ſo great an Alteration is come about, but he aims only at the deſcription of the <hi>Pox,</hi> a new way of Cure for it, and laſtly how many ſecret wayes it may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated or ſpred abroad; which laſt part of his Diſcourſe tends to illuſtrate the truth of what I purpoſe to make out, <hi>viz.</hi> the new Specification or change of nature, which it hath beſtowed upon all other Diſeaſes: Only in his Preface he hath a few Hints concerning this, but very ſhort, the Body of his Diſcourſe bending to another End; but he ſaith withall, that the conſideration of this general miſchief wrought by the <hi>Pox,</hi> was one reaſon which induced him to write of the nature of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall here tranſcribe the words of his <hi>Preface,</hi> becauſe they make much to my purpoſe. <hi>One occaſion of my Writing</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>was my obſerving the ſtupendious growth and ſpreading of two depopulating Diſeaſes, the</hi> 
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:48729:41"/> Venereous <hi>and the</hi> Scurvy; <hi>and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereupon into their effects, in the</hi> yearly Bils of Mortality, <hi>I found them ſo benigne, that it gave me occaſion to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the myſtery of concealment: I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the</hi> Conſumption <hi>to have ſlain its Thouſands, and the</hi> Venereous Diſeaſe <hi>ſcarce its Hundreds: I concluded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, that</hi> Dolus latet in generalibus, <hi>Conſumption's Back is broad enough to bear ſuch Mocks: I perceived alſo, that the</hi> Scurvy <hi>had ſcarce a conſtant name in the killing Catalogue, though it deſtroy more than any Ten of its Fellows; but the</hi> Dropſie, Fevers <hi>of many kinds, &amp;c. have great numbers dead at their Feet. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded thence,</hi> Filiae devorârunt Matrem. <hi>I obſerved alſo the Mortality and pining of Families, their Generations gaſping, and ſoon run out, one treading on the heels of another, which made me to enquire what ſhould be the occaſion; I accuſed their pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering diet, effeminate education, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature marriage, and indiſcreet covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in taking a weak, crooked, or rickety Woman (for her Portion) to be</hi> Mater-familias. <hi>But my thoughts reaſoning againſt the ſufficiency of this enumeration,</hi> 
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:48729:41"/>
                  <hi>as not of ſufficient conſideration, they carried me with greateſt reaſon to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate their Diſeaſes; and finding the</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereous Diſeaſe <hi>amongſt them, I was ſtrong in my conjecture, that this Malady, traduced in the Seed of Parents, and Milk of Nurſes, hindring Nature from accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing her intent of perfection, hath brought this calamity upon Families,</hi> Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret Semini lethalis Arundo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I obſerved further, that hereby one principal end of Marriage, to propagate a ſtrong, healthy, and numerous poſterity, ſit to traduce the being, name, and memory of Parents, to ſuch an eternity as their mortal condition is capable of, was much made void: For, in this wanton, painting, patching, perfuming, Iſſuing Age, a man knows not whom or what he takes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or his Son in Marriage, a Bleſſing, or a Curſe, whereby not only our own Bodies are indanger'd and damnified, but Poſterity primarily, fundamentally corrupted, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated, hearts of yoak-fellows alienated, Jealouſie let in, and indeed an uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life together, becauſe they cannot get a-ſunder, like two Dogs in a Chain ever ſnarling, and all becauſe the abuſeful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi>

                  <hi>in Marriage</hi> manet altâ mente re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I obſerved alſo, that all Pretenders to Phyſick gave out a more than ordinary Skill in the</hi> Venereous Cure; <hi>yet ſcarce one Patient of Ten went off from them ſound, as by relapſes it too ordinarily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. I was therefore led to believe, that either the ignorance of the Diſeaſe, or ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facedneſs to diſcover it, made them carry it about them too long; or elſe the ignorance of ſuch as they applyed themſelves to, or the impatience of the Patients to bear a Cure, gave the Diſeaſe this advantage: For, though by Palliation the dolorous Symptoms were baffled, yet the virulent Cauſe was left behind in the dark, deep in their Spirits and Bones, to make future work for the Phyſitian. Hereby their Patients are deceived, who not being able to judge, think better of their Diſcovery than is meet and ſafe, and find by ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that (the next evoking Seaſon) the Diſeaſe having gotten ſtrength by lying in Trenches, breaks forth more dangerous than it was at its firſt On-ſet. My Scope therefore in publiſhing this Treatiſe, is, to preſent a good office to the world, by</hi> 
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:48729:42"/> 
                  <hi>entring the Liſts with this Champion. And ſince this Enemy playes ſmall Game alſo, and is come down ſo low as the Spinſter, I have therefore made him ſpeak plain Engliſh, (not without due reſpect to Modeſty and better <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings) that ordinary Capacities may be able to judge of their own Condition by their own light, and in ſeaſon look out for relief, before cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and the further Enervation of their own Bodies. For, though people of both Sexes may be privy to their own perſonal integrity, yet what lurks in their humours from Parents Seed, or Nurſes Milk, they are ignorant of: And, however no preſent Symptoms thereof diſcover it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, much leſs to others; yet the</hi> Fomes
<hi>of it oft and long lying obſcure, doth tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a preſent defilement in Generation to Poſterity.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>I have read many Authors on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and found ſatisfaction in none. I perceive, that on this, as on other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, they too much tread in the ſteps of their Anceſtors, and reſt in their Dictates without further Inquiry, ſwelling their Volumes with Tranſcriptions into their own Methods, which ſerve to fill men's Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>

<hi>viz.</hi> 1. By <hi>Carnal Contact,</hi> 2. By <hi>ill Cures,</hi> 3. By acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Contagion,</hi> 4. by Hereditary <hi>Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> 5. By
<hi>Lactation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:48729:43"/> 1. By <hi>Carnal Contact.</hi> This being a matter evident by every dayes obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that the Mutual Attrition of Bodies in that Beſtial Act, is the ready common Road of communicating the Pox from one to another, I ſuppoſe it were time loſt to inſiſt upon it, and it may with more purpoſe be ſpent to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt a Truth of much importance to be laid open for the ſecurity of Mankind, which it concerns all men to take notice of; and it is this: That after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of that Folly with an unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Perſon, though there appear no Sign nor Symptom of a Diſeaſe for the preſent, yet it may be latent and lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king within the Body, many years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it make any diſcovery of it ſelf ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in its own nature, or in the diſguiſe of other Diſeaſes. This may be proved many ways; for, it is frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that Common Women who have long lived in that wicked courſe of Proſtitution, have many years continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without any manifeſt effect of the Malignity of that Diſeaſe upon their own Bodies, and yet the Diſeaſe lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within hath inabled them to infect
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48729:44"/> (it may be) ſome Hundreds of others. And the like hath been obſerved of men infecting women, yet thoſe men not privy to the ſenſe or knowledg of any Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on actually reſident within themſelves, though otherwiſe they know they have ſufficiently deſerved it: which one would think ſhould be ſad News to all the <hi>Strikers</hi> of both Sexes, to hear that even in this world there can be no ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the puniſhment of this Sin; 'tis commonly but <hi>Touch and Take;</hi> and if any offend, though but once, they may be ſurprized by the venom; and if they ſhould perhaps ſcape free from the Taint, yet 'tis rare; and here lies the miſery, they are not ſure that they are ſo. But that you may not wonder how this can come about, that ſome are made ſad examples of the Infection, and others not; and that ſome that practiſe wickedneſs moſt of their dayes ſeem ſound even to old Age, while upon others, after but one Coition, the Diſeaſe breaks out with violence; or why ſome Sinners ſeeming ſound o themſelves, are yet infectious to their Copes-mates; I tell you in the language <pb n="65" facs="tcp:48729:44"/> of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Wynel,</hi> it may be aſcribed to many Cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the various Diſpoſitions of Bodies; for, ſome are more prone to this, or that Diſeaſe, and therefore take it ſooner, becauſe Nature makes leſs reſiſtance: which alſo is the reaſon that they who have any part of their bodies weaker than other, do receive a Diſeaſe ſooner in that part: For example, let a man that hath the
<hi>Gout</hi> be venereouſly infected, and he ſhall find it more to prevail and afflict him in his Feet. So on him that hath weak eyes, if this Pocky Diſeaſe ſupervene, his eyes are ſooner and more afflicted than other parts: And the Truth is, the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm any perſon is in the Spermatick Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Members of Generation, the more eaſily the Infection makes its way to the Blood, Humours, Spirits, and Parts of the Body, and the whole Body ſuffers under its Tyranny; but if the Body be ſtrong, then the Venom is kept under in a lurking ſtate, till the vigor of nature decaying either by intemperance, or either by Time, or by the invaſion of ſome other Diſeaſes, it takes thereupon <pb n="66" facs="tcp:48729:45"/> an opportunity to break looſe, and ſhew it ſelf in its own Colours, or the diſguiſe of ſome other Malady that joyns Iſſue with it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Careleſneſs, Sordidneſs in neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own Bodies,</hi> is another Cauſe;

Beſides, the new Diſeaſe falls in when Nature is weak, low, and languiſhing, ſo that its expulſive Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cannot keep out, nor drive off the Diſeaſes new or old.

In the mean while, it is evident enough, that this Diſeaſe paſſeth by the mutual Act of Male and Female, even from this one Obſervation, that where-ever either of the Mates is ſcorbutically tainted, the other never ſcapes, but catches the Taint more or leſs, and ſo, like the <hi>Pox,</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it ſelf more or leſs according to the variety of the Tempers and Diſtempers of the Bodies on which it ſeizeth; or elſe not at all, till through decay of nature, or by ſome other Accident, it hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſhew it ſelf in its own Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, or in the garb of other Diſeaſes. <pb n="76" facs="tcp:48729:50"/> If any think he hath reaſon to gainſay this, let him firſt obſerve <hi>the Courſe of things,</hi> before he oppoſe it.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48729:56"/> ſo the great Maſters of the Faculty which have been ever ſince, have very little mended the Matter as may be ſeen by the ſeveral Pharmacopeia's Authoriſed in the world, out of all which I do profeſs I cannot pick one Compoſition proper to purge Scorbutical Humors in ſo gentle and effectual a manner as they ought to be, but inſtead of being eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated, they are the more exaſperated thereby, and contract the greater acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony—.

The truth is, though Purgation be neceſſary to be uſed in this Cure, yet it muſt be gentle, and performed by Specificks, which are but few good Ones in uſe; and the main of the Cure muſt be managed by ſuch Alteratives as will dulcifie the Blood; and they muſt reſpect likewiſe the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of the <hi>Pox</hi> as well as the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> elſe little good will be done, theſe two being inſeparably combined in their Principles, as hath been ſignified al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

<hi>Scurvy-Graſs, Water-Creſs, Common Wormwood, Water-mint, Horſ-radiſh,</hi> and the reſt of that ſort, do a world of miſchief, whereas they are very proper in Bodies whoſe Maladies lie in a fix't Salt that needs a Reſolvent volatiliſing power to remove it; or that abound with dull, inſipid, flat, dead Humors, like decayed depauperated wines, which will never be reſtored to any tolerable State, unleſs you ſeek to cure them by adding ſuch Ingredients as will <pb n="94" facs="tcp:48729:59"/> make them ferment anew within the veſſel.

<hi>Immediate</hi> is that which is communicated by the groſs Contact of a Diſeaſed Body, as when one lies with a Leprous, a Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, or a Venereous Perſon; this every one grants may be done: Contagion <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,</hi> is, when one is infected by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of ſome certain Body, though he touch not the Body of any Infectious Perſon; which mediating Body moſt commonly is the Air, it being the vehicle that conveyes thoſe <hi>Effluviums, Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> or <hi>Inviſible Atoms,</hi> as it were ſmall ſhot, to do Execution upon perſons at a diſtance. This fine way of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſuits not with the Conceit of a Brain, that meaſures every thing by the groſs Philoſophy which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ties men to in the Schools: Wherefore 'tis a wonder to me, why ſo Learned a <pb n="98" facs="tcp:48729:61"/> Man as

<hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that Venom may lurk in the Body, without ſhewing it ſelf, and 'tis inſtanced particularly in the Venom proceeding from the Bite of a <hi>Mad Dog;</hi> yet neither <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> nor theſe, nor any other of his Followers to this day, can give any reaſon why it ſhould lurk ſome moneths or years without any ſign diſcovering it: So this Diſeaſe the <hi>Pox</hi> may lurk, but the manner how, with the reaſon why, we can onely gueſs at, <pb n="102" facs="tcp:48729:63"/> and that is when it comes by <hi>Coition.</hi> Then (ſaith <hi>Wynel)</hi> the <hi>Proluvies</hi> of it being viſcous, tenaciouſly adheres to the Bowels, and is mingled with the Humors and Spirits; but becauſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of its preſence cannot clearly, and by manifeſt effects be ſhewed but on ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Bodies; therefore while this venere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Illuvies</hi> doth find Bowels ſo ſtrongly Spirited, as they make great reſiſtance and refuſe it, and obtrude it into the By-Cavities of the Body, (where it lies fermenting) the Diſeaſe reſideth eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in this <hi>Venereous Illuvies,</hi> and is not communicated to the outward Parts: So that when, how, and where this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe begins, acts, and creeps on, is not perceived. There are Workings, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, and Morbifick Senſations in the Body, which are not at all in ſtrong Conſtitutions perceived by their proper Cauſes, and are oftentimes attributed to other than their own; ſo that if you put together the time wherein the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els reſiſt the Venereous Poyſon, and the time wherein it worketh inſenſibly, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the time of the Bodies State Neutral, it may amount to many years before the Effects, Symptoms, and <pb n="103" facs="tcp:48729:63"/> Evidences, do diſcover the Diſeaſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly preſent; and yet that 'tis privately ſetled in the Body, often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by ſuch a perſon's infecting another: Thus you have in <hi>Avicen</hi> a Story of a young woman nouriſhed up by degrees with a poyſonous Diet, who was never poyſoned her Self, yet poyſoned all that had carnal uſe of her.

                  <hi>how this is poſſible in Nature, I will in few words relate to you.

And again, each Spirit which is encumber'd with any unnatural and Antipathetical Accident, deſireth to ſhake off contentious Antipathie, and to re-aſſume that peaceful Sympathie which it enjoyed before, but finding it ſelf</hi>

Wherefore as Spirits are by union joyned together and multiplyed, like Oyle added to Oyle, ſo doth the infectious Flame encreaſe, and feed equally upon them both: For, as the ſound Spirit deſireth the ſociety of his like to comfort it, and the corrupted Spirit ſo deſired, doth alſo covet the ſound Spirit to aſſiſt it againſt his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; ſo Corruption is ſucked in by them both, and Antipathy is forced to rooſt amongſt them, and forſaketh them not, till it hath penetrated and gnawed even into their bowels, and poyſoned their very En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails.</hi> And thus you ſee, thoſe Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetick and Antipathetick Operations at a diſtance, which <hi>Valleſius</hi> ſaith are tranſacted by <hi>Incorporeal Qualities,</hi> and our late Writers, by the Efflux of little

<hi>the Diſeaſe</hi> (they ſay) is lodged <hi>in a ſlow, dull, viſcous matter,</hi> which though in moſt Caſes it be falſe (for, I have known many infected with ſo active a Venom, as hath ſet them all in a Flame, and almoſt blown them up in three days) yet admit it were always lodged in ſo dull a matter, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he and they all agree, that from the dulleſt and groſſeſt Bodies there ariſe fine vapors and ſpirituous Subſtances, which in other places of their works are better termed <hi>Particles, Bodikins, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, Ferments,</hi> and I know what little inviſible Matters, containing Virulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies <pb n="130" facs="tcp:48729:77"/> and Infections, which have power to alter into their own likeneſs, what Bodies ſoever they meet with that are capable of the impreſſion: which having been confeſſed alſo in other parts of their Works, and being conſentaneous to the ſenſe of our beſt Modern Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, it matters not what their private Phantſie be in one place touching a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Diſeaſe, when in ſo many other Places, they concur with the publick ſenſe of other the beſt Authors concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general nature of Contagion, and the ſpiritual delicate manner of its conveyance from one Body to another: For, thus they touch one another; though not viſibly, after the manner of common Contact, yet every jot as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, by the intercourſe of thoſe Corpuſcles which paſs to and fro be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt rhem. And thus, I ſuppoſe, it is clear enough how the <hi>Pockie Lues</hi> may be propagated by accidental Contagion, even to innocent perſons: But you will ſay, if this be ſo, who then can be ſafe? I anſwer, there is no Aſſurance for any one; only I determine, according to the ſenſe of all Authors, that ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being naturally of more weak En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals, <pb n="131" facs="tcp:48729:77"/> Conſtitution, and Spirits, and more luxurious or looſe in Converſation than others, becauſe leſs able to reſiſt the influence of Contagious Corpuſcles and Ferments, which are continually float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down in the Ambient Air, ready to aſſail all perſons that come in their way.</p>
               <p>Now all that hath been manifeſted in the paſt Diſcourſe in reference to the <hi>Pox,</hi> is, by the ſame force of Reaſon, applicable alſo to the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> which is reckoned by all Writers among <hi>Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Diſeaſes,</hi> and ſo muſt needs have its Rambles and Rencounters at the ſame rate, and may take up its reſidence at pleaſure, and become Joint-Tenant with the other in any Earthly Tabernacle.

                  <hi>ſame reaſon in this as in the French Pox: For, as that Contagion may be admitted by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Parts of the body, and being once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, doth by little and little penetrate into the whole, and not only taints the ſpirits and humors, but imprints the like Diſpoſition upon the ſolid Parts; ſo alſo the Scorbutick Contagion, which way ſoever it be admitted into the Body, infects and taints the Blood, and imprints the like Diſpoſition upon the Bowels ordained to Nutrition, and weakens them ſo, that they are not able in the future to generate good blood, but that which is vitious and Scorbutick.</hi> The learned <hi>Horſtius</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe declares it a Contagious Diſeaſe,

               </p>
               <p>Thus having ſhewn in part, that both the <hi>Pox</hi> and

The Cauſe of this Event</hi> (ſaith he), <hi>is becauſe the</hi> vis Formatrix, <hi>the Formative Power, though it hath the</hi> Idea's <hi>of all belonging to the Father, yet it is not equally excited by them all unto operation, but by ſome more, by others leſs, or not at all.

Beſides, it is obſervable, that there is a great difference which may ariſe from the Conſtitution of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; <pb n="142" facs="tcp:48729:83"/> for, the Grand-Father's Wife may be of ſo excellent a Conſtitution, as that what ſhe contributes in mixture, may ſerve ſometimes to correct the ill Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gotten into his Seed; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary may fall out in the Son's Wife, and ſo the ill Ferment in the Son's Seed comes to prevail over the Grand-Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; which myſtery is thus deſcribed by the Learned

                  <hi>Paragraph</hi> of the firſt Section of that Tract touching the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> among other Cauſes which hinder the appearance of an Hereditary Diſeaſe, he reckoneth this, <hi>That ſometimes by the power of the Natural Balſam of the womb, the ſtrange Rudiments or Ferments of Diſeaſes are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and overcome.</hi> And in the <hi>Second Section</hi> and firſt
<hi>Paragraph,</hi> he ſpeaks <pb n="143" facs="tcp:48729:83"/> more fully, <hi>That ſometimes the Grand-Sire infected with the Scurvy, propagates this Diſeaſe, not upon his Son, but upon the Grand-Child, the Son in the mean while being free; becauſe it may ſo fall out, that he may have a Sigillation or Character impreſſed upon him from the Grand-Father, the active power whereof is obliterated by the excellency of the Mothers Seed and Blood; which nevertheleſs breaks forth again in the Grand-Child, in caſe he hath a Mother of Conſtitution weaker than was the Grand-Moiher.</hi> The illuſtration of which Truth, he ſaith, is more amply ſet forth in
<hi>Mercatus.</hi> By the like propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reaſon it may come to paſs alſo, that Brothers and Siſters of the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, may happen to have ſome more ſome leſs Tokens of theſe Contagious Diſeaſes upon them, and ſome none at all, becauſe the Bodies of their Parents may at ſometimes, be in better temper, their Seeds more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and flouriſhing, and conſequently, have leſs of the Contagious Ferment im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on them, than at other times, according as their Bodies come to be more or leſs altered by the accidental Emergencies and Extravagancies of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48729:84"/> Life.—But enough of this; let it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that the great Increaſe of the <hi>Pox</hi> and <hi>Scurvy,</hi> and of other Diſeaſes alſo not ſo Contagious, by Hereditary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, is a Matter that the world is very well convinced of, therefore I ſhorten this Diſcourſe.</p>

Have a ſpecial care therefore, what Woman you chuſe for a Nurſe; for, I have ſeen many a Child undone in its Conſtitution, by putting it abroad to Nurſe; for though the Woman may be careful, yet all may not be right with her; and on the other ſide, where Prudence hath been uſed, I have ſeen many a weakly Child, wholly altered for the better in its Conſtition; and the Seminal ill Impreſſions derived from the Parent have been ſo far ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and altered, that the Child hath gained as it were a new Nature, and put on the good Conſtitution of its Nurſe.</p>

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times likewiſe the Milk is of a Cadave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nature, as when the Nurſe either proves with child again, or grows Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh, <pb n="150" facs="tcp:48729:87"/> or is under grief; or ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Diſeaſe, or cauſe, lurks within, whereby various Impreſſions are fixt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Milk.

               <p>But you will ſay then, what would you have us do to bring up our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? Is not Milk the Food ordained for them by God in the Courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? and can any thing be more proper than what is moſt natural? I anſwer, that nothing is more natural and proper, provided that the Milk do not ſtream from a Corrupt Fountain; but ſince that in this
<hi>Venereous</hi> and <hi>Scorbutick Age,</hi> the Frame of Nature for the moſt part appears corrupted, and that even in Country-Cottages, which lie remote from the Contagion and Converſe of the greater Towns and Cities, and partake not of the exceſſes of Luſt and Diet, it it <pb n="151" facs="tcp:48729:87"/> is a hard matter to find out a Woman <hi>in puris naturalibus</hi> a Nurſe untainted, and requires a curious head and eye to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern her: and ſeeing when all is done, there can be no certainty, becauſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her Husband may be ſome way Tainted, or her Parents that begat her; and the Seminals of that Taint tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from them or one of them, to her by generation, may be latent in the blood, and ſhe ſound only in ſenſe as to herſelf, and but in outward appearance to others; therefore She that uſeth good judgment in chuſing a Nurſe for her Child doth well, and may continue it there two or three Months for neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſake, till the Child come to ſome ſtrength; but She doth better that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves it from the breaſt as ſoon a She can, and be takes her ſelf wholly to the breeding of it up by hand; for ſo, a harmleſs Suſtenance may be prepared, not ſo eaſily corruptible in the Stomack as Milk is, and ſecure from thoſe ill Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and Tinctures which may come along with the Milk from the Nurſe, notwithſtanding all the care and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that hath been uſed in chuſing her. I am the more large in diſcourſing this,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48729:88"/> becauſe 'tis grievous to ſee how many thouſands of healthy children do ſuffer by Nurſing with Womans Milk; when as very few who are bred up by hand do miſcarry, or ſuffer ſuch ſtrange di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers and afflictions as everywhere befall the other; Nay, in the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, it hath been often obſerved, that when the children nurſt by ſuch Milk have two or three in number ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been miſerable ſickly; the reſt born afterwards being bred up by hand, have meerly by this alteration of the manner of Nurſing, proved ſound and lively. If it were needful to inſtance in a matter, that, by obſerving, you may ſee with your own eyes, I might inlarge; only I tell you, <hi>Helmont</hi> hath a Story of an Earl, whoſe Fourth Son he ſo ordered in breeding up by hand, that he became more ſound, ſtrong, tall, ingenious, and valiant, than the reſt of his Brothers.</p>

For, of old great Armies were led up and down in</hi> Europe, Aſia, <hi>and</hi> Africk, <hi>without any notable Contagion, and their Muſters were commonly not much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed; but now, no ſooner is a Siege begun, but immediately the Beſieged die within, and the Beſiegers alſo without, by ſome ſtrange popular Peſt; and when the Siege is over, hardly a Company, or Troop, marches forth, but there follow Wagons la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with ſick men. Not long ſince, a Camp-Fever brake forth in an Army of ours, of a profound Contagion, killing men without</hi> 
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:48729:94"/> 
                  <hi>Thirſt or Heat, which ſome would have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Impurities and Naſtineſſes of Camps, Mariſh grounds, Houſes, together with the neceſſities of the Souldiers, as the Cauſes of ſuch unuſual ſickneſſes; and ſo upon this ſuppoſal, Phyſicians manage the whole buſineſs of Curing; as if Camps had been more cleanlily kept of old, when ſuch ſtrange Peſts and unuſual Fevers were not ſeen among them. But I know, that as often as any Fever of the old ſtock doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall a Body, that is actually under infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the French Diſeaſe, or that formerly hath had it, but was ill cured; immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Fever aſſociates it ſelf with the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous Reliques</hi> (or lurking Ferments) <hi>of that</hi> French Lues, <hi>and from it borroweth Poyſons, which produce that Fever called the Malignant and Camp-Fever; after which, the Contagion propagates it ſelf, even upon ſuch perſons as are free from the ſaid</hi> French Lues; <hi>and having the Fever as it were for its Father, and the</hi> Lues <hi>for its Mother, the new-born Monſter being a Mongrel begotten of two diſtinct Diſeaſes, ſtarts up a Third Thing different from both its Parents. Hence it comes to paſs, that as well Fevers as Peſtilences, march diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed</hi> 
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:48729:95"/> 
                  <hi>and unknown; for, the</hi> Lues
<hi>being lock'd within the feveriſh</hi> Chaos, <hi>goes on to ſpread it ſelf along with it, and becomes Epidemical, to wit, this unluckie Monſter of the</hi> Lues, <hi>being unlike both its Parents, and a treacherous Venom, becomes like a Peſt, and renders the Peſtilence it ſelf, by adding a new putredinous Ferment, more cruel than it was wont to be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly, never was more ſubſtantial Truth delivered by an Author in ſo few words; for, though this Nation (through Gods bleſſing) hath not been of late years puniſhed with the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as formerly; yet the Armies that have been marching throughout the late Wars, have ſufficiently felt the Fury of Malignant Fevers, of ſo different a Nature, that Fevers ariſing in ſome years have alwayes varied in Symptoms from thoſe that fell out in other years: Nor was it thus of late only in our Armies, but in our Towns, Cities, and Villages, and hath been ever ſince; yea, theſe 3. years laſt paſt, though no great numbers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with former years have been caſt down by Fevers, yet thoſe that have been (both Fevers and Small Pox) have <pb n="165" facs="tcp:48729:95"/> been odd kind of Diſtempers, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to any old Claſs of Fevers, and have alwayes puzled Phyſicians to deal with them. But this is no more than what agrees with the Account that is given of them by

               </head>
               <p>THat <hi>Worms</hi> are, and may be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of ſome bigneſs, and of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſhapes, not only in the Bowels, but in every other part of the Bodie, is a matter ſo obvious in every Author of Note, and by continual Obſervation, that I ſuppoſe, none will deny it: and that they are in theſe days more frequently appearing in all manner of Fevers, and other Diſeaſes, than in former time, is by experience ſeen, and there is reaſon <pb n="176" facs="tcp:48729:101"/> for it, becauſe by the intermixture of
<hi>Pockie</hi> and <hi>Scorbutick Ferments,</hi> humors are more vitiated, and a more poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous putredinous Diſpoſition or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is introduced into mens Bodies, than was wont to be in elder time. In the years 1660. and
1661. (as I have hinted in my ſecond Chapter) there raged in the Country a Malign Fever, and I my ſelf found worms coming from all people of all Ages from two years old to 70. of both Sexes; for I ſo ordered Juleps and other means, that I ſtill min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled ſuch Remedies with them, as might kill Worms, or alter the Wormatick matter which abounded within the ſick every where; This I then began to do, and have done it ever ſince; not only in
<hi>Fevers,</hi> but I mingle ſuch Remedies conſtantly in all other Caſes, and do find Worms frequently brought away from People in years, as well as the younger Fry: Therefore this Scope I continually propound to my ſelf, and commend to others that they ſtrike at Worms, and be continually deviſing Remedies which may ſuit with the main Diſeaſe, (let it be what it will); and withall alter the Wormatick Matter, if <pb n="177" facs="tcp:48729:101"/> there ſhould be no Worms to kill; for, this I find, that though the matter do not ſometimes breed the Animals, yet as long as the Wormatick Cadave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Humor and Matter remains in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, within the Body, ſo long the Body languiſheth, and ſometimes will have all the Symptoms that attend Worms actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exiſtent; and no cure of the Main Diſeaſe, with which 'tis complicated, will go forward, till that Verminous Humor or Matter be extinguiſhed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: which being done, and the Cure wrought by mingling Anti-vermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Medicins with the other, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon conclude, a matter near of kin to the Worms was A Con-cauſe (if not the only Cauſe many times) of the Diſeaſe, though I ſee no Worms actually come away.</p>
               <p>This is a Courſe that had its riſe firſt from my own private Speculation; for, though others have written of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Worms with other Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, yet none ever took notice of it as ſo general a Buſineſs. And if others will take to the putting of it in practiſe, by providing themſelves with various <pb n="178" facs="tcp:48729:102"/> Remedies of that Nature, fit to be mingled with other, in Diſeaſes either Acute or Chronical, they will find the ſucceſs exceed their expectation.</p>
               <p>But ſince the time that I firſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this Conception, I have met with a Book, which, though it cannot confirm me more in Judgement, than I am confirmed already by my own Practiſe; yet it pleaſeth me to ſee a Notion concerning Worms more finely improved, than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I thought of before: The Author of it is

He exhorts the Phyſicians of <hi>Leipſick</hi> to follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of
<hi>Kircherus,</hi> by aſpiring after No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more ſublime, than what are to be found in the common Doctrines of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and Phyſick, and ſaith, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they will acknowledge that Man born to open the Eyes of Philoſophers and Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, who err and go aſtray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Deſign of this Book is, to treat of the
<hi>Peſtilence,</hi> its Original, Cauſes, Signes, and Cure; The occaſion of his writing was the ſtrange Nature of the Peſtilence which raged at
<hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi> Anno 1656. and from thence flew to
<hi>Rome;</hi> the Symptoms whereof were ſuch as agreed not with the old Deſcriptions, and baffled all the old Antidotes and Cordials, and puzled the Phyſicians in all their Conſultations about the Cauſes
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48729:103"/> and Cure of it: Which <hi>Kircherus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, and pondering various Cauſes, at length he pitched upon thoſe
<hi>Effluviums, Atoms, Corpuſcles,</hi> or <hi>Ferments,</hi> which (in the ſame ſenſe that I have deſcribed them in the Third Chapter) do conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually flow forth of all groſs Bodies through the Air, whereby even the ſaid groſs Bodies do touch and take with one another, according as they are capable to receive Impreſſions from each other, through the working and counter-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Intermedial flitting Atoms or Bodikins, which when they iſſue from Contagious Bodies, impart ſomewhat of their own Natural Venom, and improve it, whereſoever they fix; and He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon concluded, that ſome ſuch little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible contagious bodies as theſe, carried through the Air, and inſinuating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Bodies of Men, did, by their pernicious Ferment, induce a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tredinous peſtilent diſpoſition in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and conſequently, the Peſtilence it ſelf, where Nature had not ſtrength enough to oppoſe and hinder the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of its Fermental Force and Power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:48729:103"/> This is no other Doctrine than what I have aſſerted before, in maintaining the like manner of propagation of the
<hi>Pockie</hi> and <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Ferment; and there is a parity of reaſon for the like propagating of theſe Contagions, as for the Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, becauſe the <hi>Ferments</hi> of Diſeaſes are by
<hi>Helmont, Horſtius, Sennertus,</hi> and others, rightly termed,
<hi>Seminia, Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia, Seminaria,</hi> Seminaries and Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, in regard they carry along with them the Seeds of the Infection of thoſe Infected Bodies from whence they flow; and, whereſoever they lodge, they are like ſeeds ſown, which hath in it a hidden power to produce its own like, and ſo they beget a Diſeaſe of the ſame kind with that which was their own Original, be it either Peſtilential, Pockie, or Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick.—But that which moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably touches the Point in hand, is, that he introduceth a new <hi>Paradox,</hi> (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf calls it) into the world, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Contagion of the Peſtilence was at that time conveyed abroad, not only by the volatility of ſuch Effluviums, Atoms, and Corpuſcles, as are
<hi>Inanimate,</hi> but by ſuch alſo as were <hi>Animated,</hi> living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <pb n="182" facs="tcp:48729:104"/> and were a ſort of <hi>Inviſible Worms</hi> or Vermicles. This might ſeem ſtrange at the firſt Report, and not to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, unleſs that which is not to be perceived commonly by Sight, may by help of Art be prſented to the Eye, and then there is no diſputing againſt Senſe. This that Author undertakes to do, (of which more by and by) and ſaith,

                  <hi>That theſe Animated Effluviums are conſtituted of indiſcernable Animated Corpuſcles, it doth appear by the multitude of Worms which are wont to iſſue out of one and the ſame Body; of which ſome are ſo big that they are preſently ſeen, the reſt remain in an undiſcernable ſtate of Magnitude, yet multiplyed in ſo great a number, as the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs Corpuſcles or Particles are, of which the</hi> Effluvium <hi>doth conſiſt; and being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſubtile, thin, and light, they plie to and fro, no otherwiſe than Atoms do, with the leaſt puff or motion of the Air:</hi> And he ſaith, Theſe Worms are ſo fine, <hi>that they inſinuate themſelves, not only into Clothes, Ropes, and Linen, but into other Bodies leſs Porous, as Cork, Wood, Bones; yea, into thoſe which are leaſt Porous and moſt compact, as metals, money,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 85.</note> 
                  <hi>but the very duſt of the Earth animated into ſuch kind of Vermicles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Georgius Agricola</hi> tells, <hi>that in his time, a Plague came by eating of Fruits, Pears, Prunes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſo that the eaters dyed in few dayes after; which Fruits ſwarmed with multitudes of indiſcernable Worms: which were no other than the Animated Corpuſcles or Particles flowing from Contagious Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes, and faſtning upon Trees and Plants, being carried thither through the Air. In the late Peſt likewiſe at</hi> Naples, <hi>many were infected and dyed preſently after eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Fruits:</hi> The uſe whereof muſt <pb n="184" facs="tcp:48729:105"/> needs be hazardous in Infectious Seaſons, eſpecially ſuch Fruits as are corruptible of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
               <p>He is much more copious in Diſcourſe about this, but I will contract him, as well as I can. <hi>Some will object, that if this were ſo, then by theſe Animated Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums or Vermicles, being blown by winds from one place to another, the whole world would ſoon be ruined by Contagion. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; that this is not wont to be, by reaſon of the divers and diſproportionate Situations of Countries, with their various Natures, Tempers, and Properties, and the divers Conſtitution of winds and Airs prevailing within them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, in the ſame City or Country, the Peſt uſually declines with the Seaſon of the year, becauſe of the Alteration of the Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In cooler Airs, theſe <hi>Animated Effluviums</hi> or Vermicles, can neither ſwarm nor live. But if you would know, how theſe Vermicles come to be made viſible, which are of ſo minute a Magnitude, and ſo ſubtil a Subſtance; the ſame Author tells us, the viſibiliy is attained <pb n="185" facs="tcp:48729:105"/> by the Inſtrument called a
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> An Inſtrument ſo made, and fitted with glaſſes at each end, as that the ſmalleſt thing will be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by it in ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a bigneſs; that the frame and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of its Parts may be diſcerned.</note>
                  <hi>Microſcope. Theſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>may perhaps ſeem Paradoxes to the Reader, but when he ſhall, as I have done, by Experiments made the ſpace of many years, by the help of moſt exquiſite Microſcopes, throughly ſee with his own Eyes, then I ſuppoſe, he will not only believe theſe things to be ſo, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by Experience, be ready to atteſt the Truth of what I have ſaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, as the certainty of theſe things is by him alledged, in reference to the propagation of that grand Evil the Peſtilence, there can no Reaſon be given why we ſhould not have an Eye upon a <hi>Verminous Diſpoſition</hi> in all manner of Diſeaſes whatſoever: If inviſible Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles, Atoms, or Particles, may be vivified on this manner, and be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a diſtance from place to place, and from a ſick perſon to a ſound, or from putrid Carcaſes to living and luſty, ſo as to beget a Verminous Diſpoſition within them, I ſuppoſe 'tis more eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that within the ſame Body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (be it through intemperance, or by any ſort of Contagion) a putredinons Matter (Blood or Humor) is prepared, <pb n="186" facs="tcp:48729:106"/> not onely the groſſer part of the Matter may be enlivened into the greater ſort of Worms, but alſo the Salient Corpuſcles, friſking Atoms, or active Particles therein contained, may be very often (if not continually) quickned into ſuch Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Animals or Vermicles; and, as ſuch, lurk in the Blood and Humors of the Body, and become the occaſion of many ſtrange Diſeaſes both Acute and Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, which we are wont to attribute unto ſome other Cauſe.</p>
               <p>The learned Author gives ſo much Light to this as hath convinced me, by manifold <hi>Experiments,</hi> which becauſe they are the beſt kind of Arguments; and the clearing of this being of very great importance to the practice of Phyſick, I will ſet down all, but make them as ſhort as I can. Before he comes to <hi>Experiments,</hi> he lays down this for a Poſition; <hi>Omne Putridum, exſe &amp; ſuâ Naturâ generare Vermes:</hi> i. e. <hi>That every thing which is Putrid, doth of it ſelf, and by its own Nature, generate Worms:</hi> whereupon he thus reaſoneth. <hi>Whereas all generation conſsſts in what is hot and moiſt, according to the Philoſopher's deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:48729:106"/> 
                  <hi>a twofold Corruption may here be conſidered; the one Natural, the other ſpecially adventitious or beſide Nature, which properly is wont to be called Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. I ſay therefore, that there is no living thing which is not lyable to Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, even as the * Philoſopher himſelf</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ariſt.</hi> 2. <hi>de Hiſt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>affirms. For the underſtanding whereof, it is to be noted, that no living thing can be generated out of what is formally Putrid. But whenas that which is putrefied, being a mixt Body, is, by ſeparation of impure parts from the pure, reſolved into its own Elements, and whereas the pure Parts na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to the mixt Body being mingled with the putrid, are agitated by heat; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as Nature always intends the beſt, hence it comes to paſs, that the external heat works the prepared matter, not into any thing that is of an Excrementitious Nature, but thruſts forth the purer Parts of the Mixt Body into ſomewhat that is animated; and this is the only Cauſe of the Original of Animals out of Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Moreover, whereas Philoſophers are wont commonly to ſay, that ſome Animals are generated out of meer Putrefaction alone, that is true, if we conceive the</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:48729:107"/> 
                  <hi>whole putrefaction of a mixt Body to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed under one Action, but becauſe no mixt Body is ſo corrupted, but that ſome of the purer Parts natural to it do remain; therefore when theſe purer Parts become Tinctured with in an ill fuliginous quality through the putrefying of the Excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Parts, hence it falls out, that the ſaid purer Parts being agitated by external heat, do thruſt forth an Off-ſpring of Animals, of the ſame Nature with the Excrementitious Parts which gave the Tincture.</hi> So much for his Philoſophy of the Buſineſs: Now for the
<hi>Experiments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſee, that the Earth, out of I know not what Putredinous Matter in its own Bowels, doth produce not only Inſects of all ſorts, but alſo various Monſters of Venemous Creatures, as Serpents, Toads, Dragons, in Dens and Caves of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which have their original from moiſture and a various mixture of viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Dregs and Slime; and the like are produced out of Ponds, Lakes, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, by the heat of the ambient Air working upon a Conflux of Terreſtrial Parts. Yea, Water it ſelf kept in a cloſe Veſſel, and expoſed to the Sun, is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb n="189" facs="tcp:48729:107"/> animated into Worms, as is ſeen by daily Experience, both in Voyages at Sea, and within the walls of our own private Houſes. Who knows not, that Worms ariſe from putrefaction out of corrupted Nutriment within the bowels of Men's Bodies? And the like from corrupt humors creeping betwixt the ſkin, ſo that the whole Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes animated by little and little, as in the Louſie Diſeaſe called <hi>Phthiriaſis?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, there is no kind of Plant which doth not out of ſlime or mucous Matter, generate a certain Worm peculiar to it ſelf; which ſecret is in theſe laſt Times diſcovered by the <hi>Microſcope,</hi> and will be more experimented. Yea, Vinegar, Milk, the Blood of men in Fevers, are perceived to be full of Worms, although not to be diſcerned by an eye that is not armed with that Inſtrument.</p>
               <p>In the Carcaſes of Men and Brutes, that wonderful Efficacy of Putrefaction in generating Worms doth very much appear: which being taught abundantly by <hi>Ariſtotle, Theophraſtus,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi>

<hi>in lib. de Arte Metallicâ.</hi> As much is ſaid of Air by
<hi>Georgius Agricola;</hi> and the ſudden ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Worms, Frogs, and Inſects (which have come down with rain upon the earth) doth confirm it. There is alſo ſcarce a Stick, or Fruit, or any other mixt Body, which doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome Animal which diſpoſeth that to Deſtruction which begat it, according to that of <hi>Lucretius,</hi>
                  <q>—obnoxia cuncta putrori Corpora, putrores Inſecta animata ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur.</q> All Bodies are ſubject to Putrefaction, and out of Putrefaction ſpring Animals. And that Worms of bigneſs viſible ariſe out of putrid Bodies, is a matter known to All; but that all putrid Bodies ſhould abound with an innumerable Swarm of Worms not to be perceived by the eye of it ſelf, is a matter that <pb n="191" facs="tcp:48729:108"/> was never known till the admired In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the <hi>Microſcope:</hi> which I my ſelf could never have believed, unleſs I had found it true by many years expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.

                  <p>Every Living Creature out of its own putrefaction educeth ſome kind of Animal, agreeable to its own Nature, and different from all others, which as I have by Experiment found true in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Herbs, and may be ſeen by Corn animated into winged Animals;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48729:111"/> ſo it holds moſt certain in Animals, as well perfect as imperfect. The Carcaſe of an Ox becomes animated into Bees; Horſes, both living and dead, generate Waſps and Scarabees. Men do breed Nits, Lice, Fleas; the like do ſome Brutes alſo. Man's rotten Carcaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Seminary of Worms. Infects putrefied generate Animals of Nature like unto themſelves. Nature is ſo ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous about promoting the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Things, that whereſoever She finds a Diſpoſition, that is, heat with a due proportion of moiſture, there She immediately thruſts forth an Animal. I could here produce innumerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances from all ſorts of Living Things, but becauſe theſe are enough for the proof of what I intend, I ſhall no longer inſiſt on them. Only this one thing I avow, that all Putrefaction hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Seminals or Seeds within it ſelf for the Generation of Animals, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excited by external and convenient Heat, do break forth into the aforeſaid <hi>Colluvies</hi> of Worms, ſo much the more pernicious as the putrefaction is more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent.</p>

                  <head>The Inference.</head>
                  <p>From this new Doctrine, eſtabliſhed by Demonſtration of irrefragable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, it clearly appears, that moſt of the odd Diſeaſes of a Malignant Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which Phyſicans know not what to make of, do for the moſt part depend upon a certain virulent and ſtrange putrefaction, which being ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by time, as it degenerates into a certain verminous and indiſcernable Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Worms, ſo alſo they occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a ſtrange <hi>Cataſtaſis</hi> of unuſual Exot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Symptoms, the Cauſes whereof Phyſicians cannot aſſign: For, as there is no ſort of Meat which is not ſubject to ſuch a wormatick production; ſo in the Body of Man there is no Veſſel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Vital Operation, which is not ſometimes affected therewith. <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius</hi> tels us of a Scorpion bred in the Brain; alſo of a Man whom he diſſected after Death, and found a world of Worms in his Liver, which were the Cauſe of his unknown Diſeaſe. Turn over the Volumes which give us the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical <pb n="199" facs="tcp:48729:113"/> Part of Phyſick, and you will find Examples of Worms, not only in the principal Parts of Man's Body, as the Heart, Liver, Brain, Lungs, Reins, Spleen, Bladder, Stomack, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in thoſe Chanels of the Blood, the Veins, and Arteries. For, whereas, by the unanimous Conſent of Phyſicians, the Cauſe of all Diſeaſes is ſaid to be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain putrefaction ſecretly lurking among the hidden receſſes of the Humors; and whereas all putrefaction upon the next opportunity produceth Worms not to be diſcerned by the Senſes; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that according to the various di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of Humors, Putrefaction ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth Venoms of divers Natures, and divers powers in working, according to the various manner of combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Malignant Humors, even ſuch a variety of Powers alſo the Animals from thence ſpringing muſt needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and become ſo much the more pernicious, by how much a Poyſon or Venom that is Animated is more violent than that which is Inanimate: And ſo it falls out, that this Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or Wormatick Venom being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeminated <pb n="200" facs="tcp:48729:114"/> by little and little, firſt infects the Maſs of Humors, then creeping on gnaws the Bowels, and diſperſing its Poyſon through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Fibres of the Body, doth, with moſt horrible Fits and Symptoms, diſpoſe a man by degrees toward his long Home. Hence it is, that Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians perceiving ſuch effects fall out beſide the Courſe of Nature, as are little leſs than prodigious, in the exot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick conſtitution of ſome Diſeaſes, they admire what the Matter is, and try all Experiments; and ſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecarie's Shops are well nigh emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied of Medicins, and yet no hope of procuring health, whereas if they did rightly apprehend the nature of the lurking Enemy, perhaps they might by appropriate Remedies reſtore the Patient: But few do imagine, that we carry about with us an Off-ſping of Animals begotten out of our own Blood and Bowels, of ſo great a contumacy, that if you overthrow their Auxiliary Forces in one place, you will find them immediatly recruited in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

<hi>Microſcope</hi> examined the bloud of men ſick of Fevers, which hath ſatisfied him over and over of the buſineſs; <hi>for, viewing the blood an hour or two after the opening of veins, I have</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>found it ſo full of Worms, that it made me almoſt aſtoniſhed, and I have ever ſince been convinced, that man, as well living as dead, may abound with innumerable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micles though undiſcernible by the eye;</hi> ſo that well may we take up the ſaying of <hi>Job, I ſaid to Corruption, Thou art my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to the Worm, Thou art my mother, and my ſiſter.</hi> Theſe Things perhaps may ſeem Paradoxes to ſome Phyſicians, but let ſuch know,
<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 241.</note> that many things lie hid in the nature of things which were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Antients, and to ſuch alſo as have lived of late years, which the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Sagacity of the preſent times hath diſcovered by the benefit of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope,</hi> and laid before our eyes.</p>
                  <p>The Reſult of all I have brought here is this: That the Bodies of men are ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be wrought on by each other at a diſtance, by the efflux and intervention <pb n="194" facs="tcp:48729:115"/> of certain Atoms, Corpuſcles, or Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and that theſe Particles ſometimes are

So much therefore to ſhew, that ſuch indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible Vermicles may be generated within us by ſecret corruptive Cauſes coming from without us, becauſe thoſe Corpuſcles carry along with them Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which have a power Alterative lodged in them, able to work upon Bodies of the ſame kind in eſpecial manner, and by Fermentation convert both bloud and humors into their own ill Nature, even as a very little leven leveneth a whole Tub of Meal. But admit this could not be, yet the Caſe concerning our new
<hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> touching Worms (great or ſmall, viſible or inviſible) to be conſidered in the conſtitution of all or moſt Diſeaſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſomwhat of Putrefaction attends all humane Bodies, is plain enough from Corruptive Cauſes lurking within us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:48729:115"/> But it may be objected, Men in all times have had Putrefaction, and ſo doubtleſs Vermicles latent in them, in Ages paſt as well now, though they had no <hi>Microſcope</hi> to diſcover them, and yet they had not ſuch ſtrange prodigious Diſtempers at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their Diſeaſes as you talk of, by reaſon of ſuch Worms or Vermicles; why then do you inſiſt ſo much upon Worms now, as a main Cauſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Symptoms and Alterations in almoſt all Diſeaſes, more than in former times? I anſwer, 'tis true, ſuch Worms (no doubt) in reſpect of magnitude (or rather little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) have lurked in the parts, bloud, and humors of men in all Ages, becauſe of Putrefaction, and have been Cauſes of ſo much miſchief as the force of their nature could extend to; but conſider,
1. That in old time, even the great Worms were not ſo frequently attendant upon other Diſeaſes, as now we find them; for in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> &amp; <hi>Galen,</hi> and their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, little is ſaid of Worms in any other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe but Fevers; but now a days we find them much more frequently in Fevers, yea and in Diſeaſes of the Lungs, Liver, Splene, Heart, Brain, Reins, Bladder, and in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and Pains of the ſides; and of the <pb n="196" facs="tcp:48729:116"/> back, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which have all vaniſhed upon the avoidance of Worms, effected by mixing Anti-verminous Medicines with other: which being a matter rare to be heard of till this latter Age, is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that now Bodies of men have uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more Putrefaction in them, for which many common Cauſes drawn from the latitude of Luxury in latter times, may be aſſigned, but I wave them as needleſs: only let me obſerve here, that in thoſe greater, as well as the leſſer Worms, the Symptoms are more ſtrange and violent than heretofore. I had a gentlewoman not long ſince afflicted with a Pain in the region of the Liver; after other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies uſed in vain, I gave her a gentle Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative mixt with ſomewhat againſt Worms: It brought a great one from her, and after once or twice more uſing the ſame remedy, the Pain went away. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a gentlewoman of quality, now in <hi>Southwark,</hi> who the laſt year had a great pain in her ſtomack, a Cough, a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flation or Tumefaction in the region of the Liver; She ran all the Round of Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Remedies, and her Body was waſted to the loweſt ebb of a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtate; but by Advice of a great Lord, <pb n="197" facs="tcp:48729:116"/> who
<hi>ſuppoſed</hi> wind to be a Cauſe, She chawed Tobacco, by which means vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting (a little too violently for ſo weak a Body) She threw up 7. or 8. Worms; whereupon the pain went immediately away, all other terrible Symptoms were at an end, and She ſoon recovered to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate, without any other means. This week, wherein I now write, an Elderly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, long afflicted with all the imaginable Symptoms which are wont to attend Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriack Melancholy, and which nothing elſe would eaſe, by giving her Pills which are wont to work out Worms, many ſtrange ones came from her, day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day. I could run out at large in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this nature; but that were more fit for a particular Treatiſe about it. If the great Worms do miſchief thus, what may we expect from the little ones, that are in the more abſtruſe and ſolid parts, and in the very bloud and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider, that as Putrefaction is more frequent, ſo it is more virulent, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in it a greater degree of Venom than in olden time: For, you may remember what is noted before, <hi>That according to the various diſtemper of humors, Putrefaction</hi> 
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:48729:117"/>
                     <hi>acquires venoms or virulencies of various Natures, and divers powers in working, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the various manner of combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Malignant Humors;</hi> and ſo if the inviſible Animals or Vermicles thence ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, ariſe now from a combination of humors, of condition more virulent and malignant than was known heretofore, 'tis no wonder, if Diſeaſes be more often cauſed by them, and become more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their effects and Symptoms. Now, if you enquire, how the humors of men's Bodies, which are the Subject of Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, come to be more malignant and Poyſonous than formerly, I, to avoid a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious repetition of things, referr you to the foregoing Chapters of this Diſcourſe, which ſufficiently point out the new Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of Putrefaction and Malignancy, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>Pox</hi> and the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> by which I have manifeſted what a marvelous Change hath been wrought in the whole Frame of the little world of man; ſo that the exotick Ferments being propagated and ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a great height of venom, in their combination with our Bloud and Humors, the venemous Product of putrefaction thence ariſing muſt needs induce a Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie in every malady, and conſequently <pb n="199" facs="tcp:48729:117"/> in
<hi>Worms;</hi> not only in the viſible ones of all ſorts, but (which is of more ſad and ſerious conſideration) even in thoſe petty Vermicles, which (whether they come into us from abroad, or breed within us) do the moſt frequent and greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, becauſe the Parts and Liquors of our Bodies are rarely free from them, yet few or no Phyſicians take notice of them, or have remedies that will reach them; and ſo theſe inviſible Vermin being neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, as well as the greater, render moſt Caſes incurable, becauſe being of a nature more poyſonous and penetrative than in former Ages, they are now, by an active exerting and diffuſing their virulency within the Body, become more able to Taint it, and more apt than ever to rage, and do prodigious executions.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe many are ſwayed in their Judgements, more by the concurrence of Teſtimonies, than any other Evidence, give me leave therefore to conclude this Chapter with the opinion of <hi>Langius,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent publick Profeſſor in the Univerſity of <hi>Leipſick</hi> (whom I have occaſion to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on once or twice before;) He, in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face before <hi>Kircherus</hi> declares himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſatisfied about theſe things, and <pb n="200" facs="tcp:48729:118"/> names one Dr. <hi>Hauptman,</hi> another <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Phyſician, who affirms the ſame in a Book entituled <hi>De vivâ Mortis imagine.

<hi>inſiſt upon thoſe many moſt faithful Experiments made by</hi> Kirche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, <hi>and others both Phyſicians and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, who have abundantly proved with the Microſcope, that upon the opening of Buboes and Tumors, they have been found full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Vermicles undiſcernible by the eye.</hi> The like may be ſaid of Wounds and Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers which ſo frequently puzzle ſuch as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devor the Cure of them. But he goes on, and diſcourſes of that terrible Diſeaſe the <hi>Purples,</hi> which ſo frequently befalls wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men within the month after child-delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for, it having baffled the greateſt Phyſicians and their moſt pretious Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, thereupon he and <hi>Hauptman</hi> laid their heads together, and concluded the Principal and Immediate Cauſe of that roughneſs of the Skin in that Diſeaſe, muſt be from ſome extraordinary Putrefaction within; <hi>and ſo examining the matter with the Microſcope, they found thoſe petty Vermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſpred upon the whole Superficies in the rough parts of the Skin; by which means you have here an Infallible experiment, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Original of that moſt Malignant</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now leſt any ſhould object it a matter impoſſible, that there ſhould be ſo quick and ready a tranſmiſſion of thoſe little Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals along with the Liquors of the Body from one part to another; let me have leave to add one Teſtimony to illuſtrate this; and it is that of the ingenious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>de Ratione Motus Muſculorum</hi> lately printed, who, page 9. after he hath ſhewn <hi>that all the Membranes of the body, as well as the Muſcles, are filled with a ſubtile ſpirituous Liquor, which perpetually paſſeth through all their Fibres, and keeps them in a due Tone,</hi> ſaith, <hi>No man can think this too much to be granted, who conſiders thoſe very very little Animals which are furniſhed with all their appertinences, and yet are leſs than the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt</hi>

And if this were Analytically and carefully done I little doubt but that men's knowledge of the Nature and Cauſes of Diſeaſes, and the ways of Curing them, would be leſs circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and more effectual than it was wont to be.

               <p>But truly, tis much more honourable to acknowledge, that <hi>the greateſt part of what we do know, is the leaſt part of what we doe not know,</hi> and thereupon to give all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of encouragement to ſearching heads to make further inquiry, and not ſtraiten the hands of any whoſe induſtry and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments may contribute toward the compleating of our Art; the Harveſt is great, and the Labourers but few; what vaſt crops are appearing in the ſpatious Field of Nature, to find work for Ages to fetch them forth! therefore it were well, if all men were invited to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Practiſe of Phyſick and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal Reſearches, in all Countreys of the world; eſpecially the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who by reaſon of their Eſtates and Intereſts, would be more able, and attain greater opportunities than other men, to enquire, and invent, and ſpend their time in Practiſe, eſpecially among the Poor: <pb n="217" facs="tcp:48729:126"/> which in former time (as we read) hath been the imployment of the greateſt Princes.

                  <hi>Cornelius Agricola</hi> tells us, was done, in his time by <hi>Joannes Ruellius</hi> at
<hi>Paris,</hi> a man of great learning, and a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Phyſician, who wrote a Book to the ſame purpoſe, with Collections concerning Diſeaſes and Remedies of Brutes, out of <hi>Apſirchus, Hierocles, Theomneſtus, Pellago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Anatolius, Tiberius, Eumelus, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus, Hippocrates, Hemerius, Africanus,</hi> and out of <hi>Aemilius Hiſpanus,</hi> and <hi>Litorius</hi> of <hi>Benevento;</hi> which turned to the great Advantage of the Publick, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Commonwealth of Phyſick; in the compiling of which Books, theſe noble Authors thought it no matter of ſcorn, to conſult all manner of Grooms, Herds-men, and other keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Cattel, and Farriers; from whoſe ruder Speculations and Practiſe, I my ſelf many times have had occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitate ways and Remedies for cure of Men, with notable ſucceſs in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; <pb n="222" facs="tcp:48729:129"/> and would men lay aſide the ſtately humor, and inquire among all ſorts of Practiſers, both upon Man and Beaſt, and improve inquiries of this nature, a far greater Amplitude would thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to the Body of Phyſick, than ever can be expected from the moſt diligent Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or the moſt lofty Speculators; all that hath been done in Phyſick hitherto, being of but little value to what may be.</p>
               <p>Enter into ſuch an humble courſe of Inquiry and Obſervation, and the more knowing you become, the more you will know, that there is abundant cauſe we ſhould deſpiſe no body. As Mr.
<hi>Boyle</hi> ſaith of ſuch as cure Beaſts, much may be learnt among them, becauſe they venture with any thing upon thoſe creatures; ſo I find much may be learnt among ſuch as ſome are pleaſed to call
<hi>Mountebanks, Quacks,</hi> and <hi>Empericks,</hi> eſpecially in Chronick difficult Caſes; for, uſually they are the poorer ſort of people that have recourſe to them, upon whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving moſt liberty to try notable Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and having often tried them with ſucceſs, they goe on, and are not (I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) ſo void of reaſon, but they know how
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48729:129"/> to improve them in their practiſe, and can from a Parity of Reaſon (which the Schools call <hi>Analogiſmus)</hi> invent new ones of the like powerful Nature, and which may give you, or me, or any other Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, (by converſe with them) occaſion to endeavour to invent ſuch, or better: now, the like opportunities are not to be had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Phyſicians of higher port, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the better ſort of Patients, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves for the moſt part with the uſe of ſuch Remedies, as their Bills upon the File, and the Apothecary will witneſs to be Authoriſed Medicins, and Safe; though I muſt tell them, other Medicins are now by time and experience ſeen to be every jot as Safe, but much more Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, which were damned by Bookmen when they were firſt invented, and do now paſs with as much credit and Authority, as if they had never been cried down or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted; and doubtleſs, he is a very Wicked Practiſer that will adminiſter any Medicin, which he knows not whether it be ſafe or no; and a very Ignorant one, that is not able to judge certainly, if he doe invent a new Medicin, whether it be fit or no, or who dares not venture it firſt upon his own Body, yet ſhall preſume to <pb n="224" facs="tcp:48729:130"/> give it to another: He that can analy ſe natural Bodies, and reſolve them into their Principles, is Scholar enough to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a Medicin. This is not ſpoken therefore to countenance any perſon ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciouſly Emperical, as will at adventure be <hi>trying of Practiſes,</hi> though they have neither Reaſon nor Experience to guide them; but rather to encourage good wits (both great and ſmall) ſeeing Diſeaſes are altered, and doe ſtill alter, and many of them prove incurable by old methods and means, that they will not be ſo preciſe as to judge of mens Inſufficiency in curing, by their skill in old learning, but rather by their knowledge of the Principles or parts of mixt Bodies, and the ordering of them for Medicin, their acquaintance with the preſent <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of mans nature and of Diſeaſes, and by their Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in making Experiments and Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies proportionate thereunto.

                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:48729:130"/>
                  <hi>to the new Diſcoveries which are made from time to time, of the Operations and power of the Productions, whether of Nature or Art.</hi> Celſus <hi>in his excellent Preface, ſpeaking in the ſence of the old Empericks, of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Phyſick,</hi> ſaith, that Remedies being firſt found out, Men began to diſcourſe of the Reaſons of them; and that Medicin was not invented after Reaſon, but Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was inquired into after the Invention of Medicin. <hi>And leſt the miſtaken name of</hi> Emperick <hi>ſhould make you undervalue ſo uſeful a conſideration, which not the nature of their Sect, but that of the thing, ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to them, I ſhall add in favor of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, though otherwiſe unlikely Remedies, that tis a Sentence aſcribed to</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>(and in my opinion one of the beſt that is aſcribed to him)</hi> Ubi res conſtat, ſi opinio adverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur rei, quaerendam rationem, non rem ignorandam; Where a thing is manifeſt, if Opinion be againſt the thing, then the reaſon of it is to be inquired after, but the Thing it ſelf ought not to be diſowned.

               <p>And truly, the reaſon why I drive this Nail ſo home, is not, that I think that noble perſon a Friend to unlearned Empericks; nor that he, who hath ſo great a portion of Learning, would be reckoned an enemy to Learning and Learned men; only, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he is of my mind in another part of his Book, where he implieth, there is no ſuch need of Learning (commonly ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted) to make a good Phyſician; for,

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48729:132"/> near Approach unto Nature (as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> calls it;) a ſtrict and conſtant obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of her Motions and manner of Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is that which gives a man light how to trace her in the darkneſs of obſcure Cauſes, when ſhe is out of order, and to reduce her into order; and an obſerving of the various effects, or non-effects, and operations of all ſorts of Medicaments, both old and new, together with a man's own manual operation in making them, will inlighten him and conduct him ſo far, as to perceive Cauſes more evidently, and take off a great patt of that Scandal hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto imputed unto our Profeſſion, that it is but <hi>Ars Conjecturalis,</hi> a meer Conjectural Art, and the beſt part of the Profeſſors but <hi>good gheſſers,</hi> and of little uſe, ſeeing that men have been too apt to argue like the Empericks in <hi>Celſus;</hi> that <hi>as long as the Cauſes of Diſeaſes and of Natural Actions, were obſcure, it was to no purpoſe to inquire into them, becauſe their Nature was incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible,</hi> and thereupon they have been as apt alſo to conclude, <hi>Ergo</hi> No need of a Phyſician. <hi>Neque enim credunt poſſe eum ſcire, quomodo morbos curare conveniat, qui unde hi ſint, ignoret; They will not believe he can know how to cure Diſeaſes, who knows not</hi>

                  <hi>from whence they proceed. And</hi> (ſaith the ſame Author) <hi>oftentimes new kinds of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes fall out in which Experience never yet gave any light: It is neceſſary therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how they began, without which no mortal man can underſtand, why he ſhould uſe one thing more than another:</hi> And therefore the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pericks had reaſon to plead, that they ought to have as much liberty to practiſe, as others, while Cauſes remain'd obſcure, becauſe all Parties were in the dark alike in reſpect of Cauſes: And if I by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Treatiſe have (as I believe I have) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd more plainly the moſt important Cauſes, latent in moſt Diſeaſes of this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Age, than hath been done by any one man before me, and made the matter eaſie to be underſtood by the meaneſt Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, certainly all being alike inſtructed, other men as well as Scholars, little reaſon is to be given why all Profeſſors ſhould not have liberty alike to practiſe, as well thoſe they term Empericks as others, ſo rational and new a Foundation being here laid to deal with our Diſeaſes, which are proved to be in a manner wholy new; and truly there is great reaſon theſe they call Empericks ſhould be pleaded for, becauſe by prying into their Experiments and Practiſes, I <pb n="230" facs="tcp:48729:133"/> was confirmed in my Apprehenſions about this matter when I firſt entertained them in my mind, and have ſince been quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by continual obſervation, to adventure upon this Undertaking, for the publick Good of Phyſicians and their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</p>
               <p>Wherefore from this plain Diſcourſe of mine, it being certain, that Diſeaſes are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new, and it being evident withall, what the Cauſes are, why their preſent ſtate and qualification is (for the moſt part) different from the old; and ſeeing a more certain way of Practiſe doth thence now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, if Remedies be found out to oppoſe and conquer them in their new Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; What remains then, but that all Profeſſors do ſet their Wits on Work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the inventing of proper Remedies? in the mean while, till that be done, it is of publick concern that they be encouraged, and perſwaded ſo to order ſome of the Medicaments which are already in uſe, that they may be fitted for the purpoſe. 'Tis incredible how much a good wit may do this way, by fitting ſome ordinary Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins to ſtrike at thoſe Cauſes, which I have labored to explain in the foregoing Chapters. What then might be done by <pb n="231" facs="tcp:48729:133"/> more generous remedies? Therefore I hope men will be excited to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on work, and in working proceed upon the Principles here mentioned, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the inventing of higher and more noble Medicins, which may be of ſo large an extent and reach, as to purſue and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thoſe cauſes whereſoever they be, and of ſo comprehenſive a nature as to cope and conteſt with them, be they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther complicated (as for the moſt part they are) or ſingle; for, theſe being now known to be the main Conſtituents in moſt diſeaſes (eſpecially ſuch as formerly ſeem'd to be moſt occult and difficult) then, if it be true, that when the cauſes are known, Cures are half done, I ſuppoſe every Practiſers Mother-wit may inſtruct him, being a man of good parts, how to form up a Method for his own uſe, by fitting it not only to the Nature and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of thoſe general cauſes, which are (more or leſs) concerned and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the ſtrange and ſtubborn maladies of this Age, but alſo to the nature of ſuch Medicaments as he is maſter of: For, a particular Method may be uſeful and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, being joyned with the uſe of ſome Medicins, which will do little or no good <pb n="232" facs="tcp:48729:134"/> in the uſe of other Medicins; as I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen.</p>
               <p>Vain therefore is that Learning which ties men up to a general ſet Method in curing, and inables them to excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for any thing they do, if they can but produce an od Aphoriſm, or Text of
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> or <hi>Galen,</hi> for a juſtification, and thereby prove (as <hi>Balzac</hi>'s Italian Doctor did at <hi>Padua)</hi> that the
<hi>Patient died with the faireſt Method in the world;</hi> whereas that ancient Prince of the Faculty, and <hi>Galen</hi> the Uſurper, being no Prophets, and little able to divine what Alterations of things would fall out in our days, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver foreſee how to frame Precepts and Rules to guide Us in our Concernments. There are many things admitted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by them in the <hi>Methodus Medendi,</hi> which may by no means be allowed in ours, as the Caſe now ſtands: It will not be amiſs therefore if I give you here an
<hi>Eſſay</hi> (as brief as I can) in making inquiry what things for the future ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded out of the Profeſſion of Phyſick as unneceſſary or falſe, and what to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; what old Foundations and Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are to be demoliſhed, and what new ones eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:48729:134"/> To doe this fully, by excurring into all Particulars, would require the compiling of vaſt volume; but I ſhall content my ſelf with ſome of the moſt conſiderable.</p>

Therefore the noble <hi>des Cartes</hi> took a more commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courſe; for, as <hi>Boreel</hi> tells us in his Life, percieving that a knowledge of the Truth was not to be found among men, or Books, he laid them all aſide, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf wholly to a contemplation of the Book of the world; and that he <pb n="236" facs="tcp:48729:136"/> might be at liberty to ſound the depths of Nature, he quitted the Converſation of men, and retired to a little Village near <hi>Egmont</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> where leading a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary life for 25. years together, without a Library, he ſpent his time wholly in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, whereby he diſcovered many things worthy admiration, for the benefit of mankind, and formed unto himſelf a new Philoſophy to lead men to Phyſick; ſuch a one as hath drawn many perſons of high parts to follow him, and lay new foundations of Medicin, more conſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous to the operations of Nature, than the Book-learning that was in faſhion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.

<hi>That if he do recede from the common Judgement, he is not the firſt that hath ſwimm'd againſt the ſtream of a received Opinion: That in matters belonging to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, thoſe things that pleaſed men formerly, will not paſs now, becauſe the Antients, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a falſe Suppoſition about the Motion of the Bloud, did very fouly and dangerouſly err. That the Art of Phyſick ought to be wholly renewed, and the old Props failing, Poſterity is concerned to take care that the Fabrick be re-built from the very ground. That ſeeing we have now gotten new lights, and a knowledge of the Cauſes of things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly unknown, it becomes not prudent men, and ſuch as profeſs Philoſophy, to hold their eyes ſhut ſtill. That though the Doctrines of the Antients be yet openly maintained in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, yet he cannot believe, but that moſt Phyſicians of a deeper In-ſight, doe from</hi>

                  <hi>their own Reaſonings form unto themſelves new</hi> Hypotheſes <hi>to proceed by. That Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick was at first Emperical, and Remedies were invented by frequent trial of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and not by general Precepts or Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; and if, after the example of</hi> Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, <hi>his Succeſſors had be taken themſelves to Obſervations only, and Experiments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt the Art of Phyſick had been advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a greater perfection and fineneſs, and with much more advantage to the ſick. But that which preſently ſhut out the light which had been at firſt ſet up, and dimmed the eyes of poſterity, was the prepoſterous endeavour of thoſe men, who haſtily, and in a manner af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their own Phantaſie, framed the Art of Phyſick into a general Method, after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of ſome Speculative Science; and ſo by this means, a copious form of Doctrin, ſpecious enough, but fallacious and inſtable, was built, before firm foundations were laid.</hi> Thus much you have from one of our Univerſity-Profeſſors; and it were well if the Univerſities would wholly follow his example, and cleanſe the Schools throughly from the Cobwebs of old Heatheniſh Philoſophy and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.</p>
               <p>Much pains hath been already taken <pb n="239" facs="tcp:48729:137"/> by the moſt acute and profound <hi>Helmont,</hi> the reading of whom I can never ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>commend to our Countrymen, now that he is printed</hi> in Engliſh; but know, 'tis not a flight reading will ſerve the turn: Ten times over is too little, though a man ſhould have the help of a Tutor to direct him. Were I worthy to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſuch a work, I could never do the world the like ſervice any other way, as I might in this, by Methodizing the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pieces of him into ſome better order, rendring his moſt ſubtile Conceptions more familiar and eaſie. And truly, the more regard is to be had to what he writes, becauſe, as he was a noble Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher by Fire, ſo before he be took him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly to this new courſe of Study, he had been an indefatigable Student in the old; having read over the tedious Works of
<hi>Galen</hi> twice, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> once, (getting his
<hi>Aphoriſms</hi> without-book) and all <hi>Avicen</hi> he read, and all the
<hi>Greeks</hi> as well as <hi>Arabians,</hi> with many modern Authors, no leſs than ſix hundred, and collected Notes out of them all; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all (he ſaith) counting what coſt he had been at, he found he had gained No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but repented of his Pains, and the <pb n="240" facs="tcp:48729:138"/> ſpending of ſo many years to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

<hi>Willis</hi> hath ſufficiently ſhewn, as ſome others his Compeers have alſo done, by their own perſonal worth and Induſtry; but then, the means to attain it, is not in the old lazie way, and by the old dull Principles; for, here lies the Bane of our Profeſſion, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Book-knowledge of
<hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and the reſt that are counted Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, is admitted in the Univerſities as a ſufficient Teſt, to try a mans fitneſs to become a Doctor of Phyſick, therefore the leſs ingenious ſpirits content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with that ſort of Learning, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeek after the other; or if they do, they reſt in a ſuperficial Acquaintance <pb n="254" facs="tcp:48729:145"/> with the uſe of ſome common Chymick Remedies which are to be had at the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries; whereas the caſe would be otherwiſe, and much more for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of mankind, and of the Art of Phyſick it Self, if the world were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded betwixt <hi>Galen</hi> and

This is to be expected rather from one that is qualified for the work by acquaintance with Mechanick and <hi>Experimental Philoſophy.</hi> Therefore very much to the purpoſe is that other ſaying of the ſame Author, who, though he appear to favor the Sect of the old Empericks, yet hath, for his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and great Sufficiency, gained this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment from many Admirers of the old Learning, that he is to be ranked next to

<hi>viz.</hi> the Notions of <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold,</hi> into the Doctrin touching <hi>Fevers,</hi> is a Cauſe why at leaſt a third part of the Sick doe run a ſtrange hazard every year of loſing their lives; or elſe miſerably languiſh and loſe the habit of their Bodies, by the ill handling of them and <hi>Agues.</hi>

<hi>Galenists</hi> have formed all their Notions about Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, aiming at an evacuation, or elſe a contemperation of ſuppoſed Humors, and Excrements; but there being no ſuch matters as they Phantſie to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient in the nature of Diſeaſes, tis no Marvel if they miſs the Curing of any Diſeaſe, which is not curable by Strength <pb n="260" facs="tcp:48729:148"/> of Nature, and Length of Time.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Melancholy</hi> (as they call it) the Receptacle which they beſtowed upon it was the <hi>Splene,</hi> pretending that its office is to ſeperate the Droſſie part of the Bloud, which cannot be elaborated by the Liver, which Veſſel they deſtinated to the purer part of Sanguification; but both theſe Opinions have of late been ſufficiently diſproved by the ingeny and induſtry of ſome ſearching heads, who determine the Liver not to be the office or Storehouſe of Sanguification; and the Splene to a nobler uſe than to receive droſſie Bloud, it appearing rather to be an Elaborator and Fermentator of the nobleſt Juyce,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Arterial</hi> Bloud, by reaſon of that grand Intertexture of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, by which it holds a near Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the vital Parts of the Body.

This ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> communicates ſeveral noble Qualities to the
<hi>Water,</hi> preſerves it from corruption, makes it penetrative, and endoweth it with almoſt all its own activity: And in requital, the
<hi>Water</hi> doth ſoften and bridle the fury of the Spirit, and makes it ſo tractable, that it may become uſeful a thouſand wayes: It is very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable while it remains in a due Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, hindring the growth of excrementiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matter in mixt Bodies, multiplying the ſubſtance, and ſtrengthning the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <pb n="272" facs="tcp:48729:154"/> and Powers both in Animals, Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, and Minerals.

               <p>The third thing viſible in the artificial reſolution of Mixt Bodies is <hi>Sulphur,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the form of Oyle; and becauſe it is an Oleaginous ſubſtance, it eaſily takes Fire: It ſwims above the

<note place="margin">Of Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> Schools aſſign but three ſorts of <hi>Concoction,</hi> or Digeſtion of Aliment; the Firſt in the <hi>Stomack;</hi> the Second in the <hi>Liver;</hi> the Third in
<hi>each part</hi> and particle of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; they are neither copious enough in the number, nor diſtinct in the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for, we cannot but (with
<hi>Helmont)</hi> enlarge the <hi>Digeſtions</hi> as to Number, and ſpecifie them in other Terms. The <hi>Firſt Digeſtion</hi> therefore we ſay is in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; the <hi>ſecond</hi> in the Firſt Gut called
<hi>Duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denum,</hi> where the <hi>Felleous liquor</hi> of the Gall mingling with the Chyle, changeth the acidity which was beſtowed on it by the Ferment of the Stomack, into another Subſtance full of Volatile Salt, whereby it is fitted for a further Proceſs. The next Digeſtion or Concoction, the old Stagers will needs have to be in the Veines of the Meſenterie as preparatory to Bloud, and in the Liver as the Finiſher of it; and to this,
<hi>Helmont</hi> agrees, but the latter Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Anatomiſts ſhew, that the Liver hath no ſhare in that work; and there is cauſe to beleeve, that the third Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is elaborated in the common Receptacle invented by
<hi>Pecquet,</hi> which is ſeated at the Root of the Meſenterie near the Loynes; <pb n="285" facs="tcp:48729:160"/> after which it is conveyed by the <hi>Ductus Chyliferi,</hi> near the Back-bone, through the Cheſt, up to the Subclavian Branches of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> where it mixeth with the Bloud, and with its ſtream paſſeth to the Heart; and there being impregnated with the noble Ferment of that Veſſel, it becomes Bloud, and puts on the Principles of Vital Power, which I may call the <hi>Fourth Concoction.</hi> The <hi>Fifth Concoction</hi> is in the Arteries, where its Spiritualiſation and vitality is perfected. Then in courſe, according to <hi>Helmont,</hi> follows the
<hi>ſixth Digeſtion</hi> or Concoction, performed in all the Members, which the <hi>Galenists</hi> made to be the <hi>Third;</hi> but neither of theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions may paſs for current, becauſe before the Bloud is diſtributed to each Part or particle, it paſſeth under more operations and Elaborations, as it circulates through other Veſſels, which I look upon as ſo many additional Digeſtions and Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. The Anatomiſts pretty well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree upon this general Circulation; and tis but reaſon; but in what order, it circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth, it matters not to our Purpoſe; it ſufficeth me to obſerve, that firſt or laſt it viſits every Veſſel, as the Lungs, the Brain, the Liver, the Splene, the Reins, and the <pb n="286" facs="tcp:48729:161"/> Teſticles, as well as the other aforenamed; and in every one of theſe it is impregnated with ſome one power or other, which none of the other could beſtow; and ſo out of all theſe Digeſtions in the ſeveral Veſſels, there reſults as it were a conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Powers, which become all united in one Point of Vitality within the Maſs of Bloud, for the maintenance of a vigorous ſtate of health within the Bodie. Now that which occaſioneth a great Defect in the Practiſe of Phyſick is, that Phyſicians are too narrow and ſhort in their thoughts about
<hi>Digeſtions,</hi> and do not conſider the nature of Diſeaſes, as they ſpring out of the Enormities, or the Defects, which are incident to every Digeſtion reſpectively; which is a ſubject too large to be inſiſted on in this Place, but might be very well worth the Diſcuſſing, by any that would ingage his Pen, for Digeſting a new Bodie of Phyſick in a juſt Volume; than which there is not a more neceſſary Work under Heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Great regard likewiſe is to be had to thoſe Energetical powers which God hath
<note place="margin">Of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> implanted in every Veſſel, whereby the work of <hi>Digeſtion</hi> in each of them is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed; and theſe Powers or Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <pb n="287" facs="tcp:48729:161"/> we call <hi>Ferments</hi> or <hi>Levens,</hi> becauſe though a <hi>Ferment</hi> be but (as it were) <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibile Quid,</hi> a very ſmall Thing, of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous and almoſt incorporeous Nature, yet it is able to leven, that is, alter and qualifie with a peculiar Tincture whatever is brought to it for that purpoſe, by the appointment of Nature. Thus the <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or Leven of the Stomack, myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſeated in that part, hath a peculiar Power of Chylification, and may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Maſter Ferment,</hi> becauſe it prepares All for the other; and the ſupreme Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator of the other
<hi>Ferments,</hi> becauſe it hath an Influence for Good or Ill upon them All; for, if this be infirm, the reſt are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately languiſhing throughout the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; which made <hi>Helmont</hi> aſſign the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack to be the principal ſeat of the Soul; and we ſee, that in ſickneſſes, it is the firſt that is out of order, and the laſt that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. If it ſends away the Chyle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly digeſted, the next offices that receive it one after another, cannot make their <hi>Succeſsive Digeſtions</hi> ſo compleat as they otherwiſe might (for, the latter Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions amend not the errors of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) and thereby Crudities or Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſtill heaped up, to the weakning <pb n="288" facs="tcp:48729:162"/> even of the <hi>Ferments</hi> themſelves, ſo long, till being tired out with labor in vain, they can do no more ſervice to the Bodie; and then by degrees it draws on to death: And thus many times the ſickneſſes which are felt in remote Parts, the Stomack is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily in fault of; and the Ferment of it being rectified, the other Ferments alſo under its command ſhare in the good of its recovery, and make a ſhift (if not too far evigorated) to recover of themſelves. In like manner, on the other hand, if the <hi>ſubſerving Ferments</hi> be at any time faulty, they recoyl upon the Stomack: Thus, if in the <hi>ſecond Digeſtion,</hi> the <hi>Duodenum</hi> fail in his Duty, through want of the
<hi>Felleous liquor</hi> to aſſiſt it, or through any other Cauſe, many times it regurgitates, and putting the <hi>Pylorus</hi> into a Fury, it crucifies the Stomack, cauſing Nauſeouſneſs, Eructa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Pains, Vomitings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The like may be ſaid from the other, till you come to the Heart, where the obſervation of its Ferment, when debilitated, evidenceth its power of reflection upon the Stomack; for, be it debilitated or diſordered, either by exceſs of Joy, or Fear, or Sorrow, or Venery, or any thing that cauſeth a dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or diſſipation of its Native Ferment,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48729:162"/> you ſee it enjoys not it ſelf, but loſeth its Appetite. Nor do they hurt the Stomack onely, but prejudice likewiſe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there being a marvelous Conſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them All, as there is betwixt the Wheels of a Watch or a Clock, becauſe they ſet one another a going, and if any one be out of order, the reſt are at a ſtand, and rather hinder than advance the Motion of their fellows. Theſe are they, which abounding with an exalted <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> are exceeding active, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually buſied in <hi>Fermental Action,</hi> for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Works of Sanguification, Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and Vegetation, for a conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Archeus</hi> in its Vital Function in every Part and Particle: And thus thoſe Noble Operations, which <hi>Ariſtotle, Galen, Avicen,</hi> and their Followers attrib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Archeus</hi> and of thoſe Ferments which attend it, in the ſolid parts, is ſuch, that if the Alimentary Juice hath not been elaborated as it ought to be in every ſhop, as it paſſeth from one to another, it comes to the laſt Digeſtion ſo imperfect, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead <pb n="291" facs="tcp:48729:163"/> of being aſſimilated to the Solid Parts, Nature rejects it as uſeleſs, and ſo it turns to vitious Excrement; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Ferments</hi> implanted alſo in the ſolid parts, wanting fit Matter to work upon for a good purpoſe, and not knowing how to be idle, begin to take ill Courſes, and by reaſon of their reſtleſs activity, do prey up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſeveral Parts wherein they dwell, and ſo by degrees conſume the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to a

               <p>In ſuch Caſes as theſe, when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
<hi>Ferments</hi> are languid, and cannot digeſt the Alimentary Juice as they ought, the more Nutritive the Food is which men eat, the more miſchief they run into, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it affords more Nouriſhable Matter than the

               <p>But to go on; let me give you the ſum of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Prognoſticks about this matter: There are in Acute and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh Diſeaſes, which are reckoned by daies, ſome daies called
<hi>Decretory</hi> or <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> in which Nature of her own accord, without help of Medicin, doth upon an <hi>odd day</hi> make excretion of ſuch noxious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors asare ſeparated by Digeſtion: Other <pb n="309" facs="tcp:48729:172"/> daies there are, called <hi>Indiciarie</hi> or Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative, which are ſuppoſed to ſignifie, by ſome precedent ſign, the coming of the
<hi>Criſis</hi> upon a <hi>Septenary;</hi> as for example, they ſay the Fourth day ſignifies what will fall out on the Seventh, and ſo you are to reckon by Fours and Septenaries, till you arive (if there be occaſion) at an Hundred. Thus, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> dividing the week into two Parts, hath digeſted it into <hi>Quaterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> or <hi>Fours,</hi> which in making the Account are alwaies Significative of the Septena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. In ſhort, ſome daies are reckoned by an <hi>odd number,</hi> others by an <hi>even number.</hi> In his fourth <hi>Book De Morbis,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>tis deadly</hi> to adminiſter a Purgative upon an <hi>odd day</hi> (which by many Inſtances and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations I know to be moſt falſe, and that in all probability Patients muſt have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Died, or been the more difficultly Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, had they not been purged, or vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon ſuch a day;) but upon

               <p>In the mean while, it will be very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
<note place="margin">Of Critical days.</note> for the information of our Countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to deſcend a little to a view of the odd Conceits of the great <hi>even and odd gamſters</hi> about <hi>Critical daies. Hippocrates</hi> himſelf was wiſer than his Followers, in this one thing, that he would not venture to aſſign the Cauſes of ſuch daies; onely he gives notice, that he in his own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had obſerved them to fall out ſo, and thereupon concluded there was an <hi>innate propriety</hi> in theſe daies to produce ſuch effects more than other daies. And <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen</hi>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:48729:175"/> ſaith, he did well in this buſineſs, to content himſelf only with Experience; but it is as lawful to object Exprieence againſt it, that in our Age all things fall out as well upon the other daies, as upon thoſe that he calls Critical. Nevertheleſs, let us ſee his ground for his opinion: its no other than this, that he ſuppoſeth a kind of Charm in the Number Seven, and in a Computation by <hi>Septenaries,</hi> ſaying, that a

               <p>Now though the grand Leader was ſo ſhie and timorous to venture upon giving a Reaſon, yet the Followers have been more hardy: ſome have aſſigned one Cauſe, ſome another, and ſo 'tis like to come to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, when the prime Dictators can agree upon Nothing. The Followers of
<hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> referred the Cauſe of <hi>Critical daies</hi> to the myſterious power of the Number <hi>ſeven,</hi> which odd number (they ſay) is more potent than an even number: For (they tell us) <hi>although number be not a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, yet it hath a ſubſtantial effect upon things from a cauſe unknown to us:</hi> that is, <hi>ignotum per ignotius decernere,</hi> to determine an unknown thing by a thing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; which Doctrin of theirs, touching number, is repeated by <hi>Galen</hi>

               <p>But he lapſeth afterward himſelf as fondly as the
<hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> and falls in with the Aſtrologers, aſcribing the
<hi>Critical daies</hi> to the Motion of the Stars, eſpecially of the Moon, as their principal Cauſe. To which I ſay no more but this in ſhort; If it were ſo, then the Squares and Weeks of the Moon would alwaies concurr with the <pb n="316" facs="tcp:48729:176"/> Quaternious and Weeks of the Diſeaſe; but this very rarely falls out. Moreover <hi>Fracaſtorius,</hi> in a particular Treatiſe which he ſet forth upon this Subject, ſaith, If the Moon hath any Power, it muſt be by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her celeſtial Light and Heat; but her Light doth not ſend forth Heat on one day more than another, but only as it is more or leſs reflected upon the earth; which happens in the Sun, when he is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or his beams more direct; in the Moon, when ſhe receives more Light from the Sun, which falls out when ſhe is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more from the Sun. If this be true, it follows then, that ſeeing ſhe is on the eighth day more remote than on the ſeventh, and conſequently hath more Light and Heat, we ought to conceive the Eighth day more likely to be Critical than the Seventh.</p>
               <p>And yet <hi>Fracaſtorius,</hi> who in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſufficiently again <hi>Galen,</hi> committs as groſs an Error himſelf, while he aſſigneth the Cauſes of Critical daies to <hi>the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Melancholick Humor,</hi> which (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old Phantſie) is ſuppoſed to have its Motion every Fourth day by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar propriety. Upon this, as the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents vainly grounded the Circuits of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:48729:176"/> Agues; ſo he ſuppoſed it might ſerve his Turn to eſtabliſh a reaſon thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, why the Fourth day is ſaid to be
<hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</hi> But ſuppoſe (as we have before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) that there is no ſuch Humor in the Body of man as that which is termed
<hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy;</hi> what then becomes of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit about the Motion of it? And admit there were ſuch a Humor, it would be hard to prove the Motion, none of the old <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Writers having ventured to give any account for it but their own Word and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Therefore he might have done better to aſſign no new Cauſe at all, when he contradicted <hi>Galen,</hi> but to have been ſilent, and to have labored rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe <hi>Galen,</hi> as

                  <hi>Moreover, the Fourteenth day it ſelf is an even day, upon which the Antients did lay ſo great a ſtreſs. Who when they contended that the eighth day hath the ſame Nature with the Firſt day, ſo that the Second Septenary or Number Seven ought to begin from thence, did thereby contradict themſelves, in not reckoning the Eighth, nor the Tenth, nor the Twelfth day, as the more powerful; for, they attributed more to the Ninth, and the Eleventh. Which when they had done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any probable reaſon, they paſſed from the Eleventh, not to the Thirteenth, but to the Fourteenth.

So alſo he ſaith, that upon an odd day, the Fever may be both more grievous, and a certain ſign of what is to come. And in another place, he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends every Fourth day as moſt efficacious in both reſpects, that is to ſay, the Fourth, the Seventh, the Eleventh, the Fourteenth, and the Seventeenth, whereby he paſſeth from odd to the account of Even. And yet here he holds not firm to himſelf, foraſmuch as the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day computed from the Seventh, is not the Fourth day but the Fifth.

               <p>I might to theſe add a large Account of the Quarrels among Authors, about the time from whence the computation of daies is to begin, but I wave it: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Patient (as we often ſee) becomes Feveriſh for two or three daies, and then it abates for three or four daies more; and a few daies after, the Fever comes on in good earneſt: Now, in ſuch a Caſe, it were well if any could aſſign a right time from whence the Computation ſhould begin. Beſides, admit a right time be pitch'd upon from whence to compute, yet to what purpoſe is it to reckon onward in expectation of a
<hi>Criſis,</hi> whenas every ſmall circumſtance will alter the Motion of the Maſſe of Bloud, and the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſmus</hi> or Concoction of the Morbifick <pb n="322" facs="tcp:48729:179"/> matter, upon which the <hi>Criſis</hi> is ſuppoſed to depend? ſo that it ſhall not come to paſs on the Set-day according to expectation, and perhaps not at all: For, I have often obſerved, that ſometimes a Purgation, ſometimes want of Sleep, ſometimes a little Broth, ſometimes a little Cold, ſometimes a ſlender Invaſion of Ill News, Grief, or Fear, and divers other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, have wrought a marvelous ſudden alteration in a Patient, ſo that all things being out of order, what orderly <hi>Criſis</hi> (if any ſuch Thing be now in Nature) can in reaſon be expected? The Truth is, there are ſo many probable Rubs in the way to hinder the proceſs of the <hi>Pepaſmus,</hi> that it is a wonder, if in the North-parts of the world, where our bloud is not ſo fine and brisk, nor the Air ſo benign, as in warmer Climates, if ever we ſee in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years practiſe ſo much as one complete Critical Solution: For (as Doctor

<hi>Colour,</hi> the <hi>Conſiſtence,</hi> and the <hi>Contents,</hi> which according to Sence are the moſt remarkable things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and the principal objects of Judgement by Urine. And beſides theſe things there is nothing elſe conſiderable in Urines.</p>
               <p>After this he proceeds to ſhew how the Colours of Urines are to be conſidered and eſtimated, according to the different ingrediency of the ſaid <hi>five Chymical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;</hi> which being diſpatched in a very delicate and particular manner, he ſums up the whole in general thus, in reference to Colour; that the <hi>paler Urines</hi> do all for the moſt part ariſe from too much crudity; and moſt of the <hi>high colour'd</hi>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:48729:186"/> 
                  <hi>Urines</hi> from <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> diſſolved more plentifully, and ſometimes from aduſt recrements cocted in the <hi>Serum,</hi> or from the groſſer contents of the Urine. And yet the Colours notwithſtanding may ſometimes by accident be altered, and appear otherwiſe than they ought to be expected from the leſſer or greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grediency of theſe Principles; but by theſe we are directed to a much more probable way of Judgement than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as from Colours.</p>
               <p>Then, in order to a right knowledge of the <hi>Contents of</hi> Urines, he that will be a curious Inquirer, ought to reſolve them into Parts, by which means he will attain Medical directions of no little moment: For, in divers Chronical Diſeaſes, it is of great concern to inquire into the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of the Bloud exactly, that the proportion of <hi>Salt</hi> and
<hi>Sulphur</hi> therein contained, and the temperature, may be rightly inveſtigated. To this end, it is convenient ſometimes to <hi>evaporate</hi> U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, or expoſe them to <hi>diſtillation;</hi> and ſometimes to
<hi>Precipitate</hi> the Contents of them, or <hi>reſolve them by Putrefaction.</hi> As <hi>Evaporation</hi> and <hi>Diſtillation</hi> ſubſerve much to the manifeſtation of the <hi>Salty Principle;</hi>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:48729:187"/> ſo <hi>Precipitation</hi> and <hi>Putrefaction</hi> do ſhew the groſſer Contents of Urines, both as to weight and meaſure; only <hi>Putrefaction</hi> is wont to ſhew the ſeveral particles of every kind ſomwhat more diſtinct, and as ſeperated from one another; for, if you let the Urine ſtand ſtill ſeveral days in an Urinal, it will be very much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered both in the <hi>Colour, Scent,</hi> and
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much I thought neceſſary for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Reader a Taſte of this new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin about Urines; which certainly is much more agreeable to Reaſon, than any thing that ever was ſaid before upon that Subject, and muſt needs be abundantly more conducible to the practiſe of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, ſeeing it directs our Judgment, not by mere outward Appearances, and bare Obſervations, as of old, but by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of our Underſtanding to the real Principles which are in Urines, the ſame as in Men's Bodies: from whence doubtleſs a more certain way of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt needs ariſe, than can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined by any other courſe that may be taken, to judge by Urines concerning the State of the Bloud and its Diſeaſes. I cannot therefore but commend that tract <pb n="337" facs="tcp:48729:187"/> of Urines to ingenious Practiſers, as a more ſure guide than any that they can meet with in former Authors; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them, by manifold Obſervations and Experiments in their way of Practiſe, to follow the example given them, for the improvement of that Doctrin, and the ſetling of a right Method in this part of Phyſical practiſe, for time to come: And I hope it ſhall not be the leſs acceptable, as other new things have been, becauſe it requires more care and trouble, than the lazie formal ſort of Profeſſors are willing to beſtow; For, I have ſeen, that the knowledge which comes by it will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly recompence the labor, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the Morbifick Cauſes in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The reputed Oracles of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,

                     <hi>A brief cenſure of</hi> Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
<hi>and</hi> Galen.</note> next place to be inquired into; whom though we ought not to reject, but to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them the honor due to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were men famous in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, yet know they were but men, albeit, ſome have endeavoured to make Gods of them; and truly, but children in the Art, ſuch as lived in the nonage of true Philoſophy and Phyſick, if they
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48729:188"/> be compared with the learned of this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Age. I would not detract from them, becauſe for ſome things we are beholden to them, eſpecially to <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> but tis neceſſary to be a little brisk in expreſſion, becauſe the world is apt to dote upon old Authors, eſpecially when they hear of honors little leſs than Divine given to theſe Erroneous Heathens: And ſome that ſpeak loweſt of them, ſay, they were infallible in the Things which they have left us. I remember <hi>Jo. Langius,</hi> in one of his Epiſtles, ſaith as much of
<hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> that he was <hi>fallere ac falli neſcius,</hi> one that could not deceive nor be deceived; which ſaying he borrowed out of
<hi>Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius.</hi> But it is the humor of many men, upon the credit of other men to fall a commending what perhaps they never ſaw, or did never underſtand, and ſo the Commendation paſſeth Cuſtomary and current from one to another, till the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality even of the learned come to give up their belief to what others have ſaid; and ſo men happen to become famous Authors, as other men many times have the good fortune to grow rich, though they never deſerved it. And yet we cannot but acknowledge theſe two were
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:48729:188"/> witty men, learned and able as the times went then, and I do belive they were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of ſo much wit, that could they now revive, and ſee what an Advance and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration hath been made in the ſtate of Phyſick, they would by common ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be induced to quit their own Principles, as very rude and inſufficient, if compared with others: wherefore we have reaſon with thankfulneſs to own what we find approvable in them, but not to lie down <hi>ſub magni nominis umbrâ,</hi> under the ſhadow of a great name, and make an Idol of it; We ſhould rather reject what runs to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and not pin the Faith of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind upon the ſleeve of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe others have done ſo; And yet ſome there are who have been ſo bold, as to ſift, and note, and upon occaſion reject him.</p>
               <p>The moſt Oraculous parts of him are
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A Cenſure of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſms of</hi> Hippocr.</note> ſuppoſed to be his <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> and his
<hi>Prognoſticks.</hi> As for the <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> we find him tripping there at every three or four ſteps, when he comes to Points of moment: the reſt, which are true, do for the moſt part fall under the obſervation of every Nurſe, and ſo in ſuch common things every She may be as Divine as He. <pb n="340" facs="tcp:48729:189"/> To clear this, it will be worth the while to take a brief view of them.—The Firſt Book of <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> contains only Rules which concern the Phyſician himſelf, what Caution he ought to uſe in preſcribing <hi>Diet,</hi> and <hi>Purgation.</hi> The five firſt
<hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms</hi> are of ſome moment, alſo, the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth are good, which forbid feeding a Patient at the time of a Paroxyſm, and in the heighth of a Diſeaſe, which certainly neither the Patient himſelf will do, nor any body elſe that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon permit, if he would, or could feed, being in ſuch a condition. The 22. is falſe in many Caſes, and deſtructive in others; for, it commands us to delay purging, till Crudities be cocted; and the greateſt part of them are incapable of Coction, eſpecially in the Diſeaſes of this Age. The 24. which allows us but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to Purge in the beginning of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and that with great Caution, is alſo very deſtructive; for, if ever it be lawful to Purge boldly, then is the time, becauſe the <hi>Orgaſmus</hi> or fury of redundant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors commenceth, and the Patient is then moſt able to bear the Remedy. But the leſs regard is to be given to this <hi>Aphoriſm,</hi> becauſe it is directly contradictory to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb n="341" facs="tcp:48729:189"/> in his ſecond Book, <hi>viz.</hi> the 29. which is indeed more rational; where he injoyns us to Purge, if at all, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Diſeaſe, becauſe (as <hi>Heurnius</hi> well ſaith upon the Text) it gives a Revulſion to the raging Humors, and takes off their Fury: And this is all that is conſiderable to be noted on the Firſt Book.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>ſecond Book</hi> the Firſt <hi>Aphoriſm</hi> of Note is the 10. which commands us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we Purge, to render the Paſſages paſſable. This concerns not us ſo much in this Age, who have ſuch noble reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as will unlock the Paſſages, as well as draw away the Humors, at one and the ſame time, and both theſe with much kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they will do: But it is very neceſſary to be obſerved by ſuch as ſtill uſe the old Purgers, which are (more or leſs) of a violent and Malignant nature; ſo that if the bad Humors cannot ſtir, the good Humors are forced, and being more fine, run away like a Torrent, to the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of the Body.—The 20. hath nothing of certainty in it; which ſaith, that young men whoſe Bodies are laxative grow coſtive when they are in Age, and
<hi>è contra.—</hi>The 23. which ſaith that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Diſeaſes come to a <hi>Criſis</hi> in fourteen <pb n="342" facs="tcp:48729:190"/> daies time; and the twenty fourth, which pretends to deſcribe a certainty of Critical Motions, are fond and falſe, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved the whole Doctrin to be which concerns <hi>Criſes</hi> and <hi>Critical daies.</hi> And truly, he before in his ninteenth <hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm</hi> confeſſeth enough to overthrow all that Doctrin, ſaying, that the Predictions of the Events of <hi>Acute Diſeaſes</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.—The 36. ſaith, that Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in healthy Bodies, and in Bodies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with ill Juices, are impairing of the ſtrength and vigor: which is a kind of Riddle that none of the Commentators can ſolve; for, if in both theſe Caſes a Purge be pernicious, when (I pray you) ſhall it be adminiſtred? But this may well enough ſuit with moſt of the old Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, which will ſufficiently afflict bodies, be they Sound or Sick; though God now hath furniſhed us with ſuch, as either in Sound or Diſeaſed bodies, will operate with facility and pleaſure.—The 37. agrees with the former. The 41. ſaith, they which are ſubject to <hi>Swoundings or Faintings,</hi> die ſuddenly: which every daies experience proves manifeſtly falſe; for, no Affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctions are more ordinary and common than theſe, yet without any ſuch <pb n="343" facs="tcp:48729:190"/> conſequent at the Heels of them.—The reſt in that Book are moſt of them agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the common Dictates of every man's Mother-wit, that hath ſeen any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Accidents and Circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sick.</p>
               <p>In the third Book, the three firſt are little conſiderable; and from the Third to the twenty fourth Aphoriſm, you have nothing but common Notions and Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks about the effects of the various Turns of weather, and of the ſeveral Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the year, in cauſing Diſeaſes; ſome of which Particulars are falſe, others frivolous, the reſt are <hi>&amp; Lippis &amp; Tonſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus not a,</hi> obvious to every one; and the whole is more fit for an Almanack than the great Monument of Phyſick. The other which follow to the end of the Book, onely tell us what we all know, <hi>i. e.</hi> what Diſeaſes are wont to befall Children and old People.</p>
               <p>In the fourth Book, he begins with great-bellied Women, and ſaith, if you purge them, it may be done in the fourth month till the ſeventh; but not in the Firſt months, nor in the laſt. This might be an uſeful Caution in thoſe daies when they had none but violent Purgers; but
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:48729:191"/> what is that to us now, on whom God hath beſtowed more Delicate Means? Why is it, that Phyſicians permit women all the time of their Childing, many times to labor and languiſh under a Load of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Humors, and very few of them think it fit to venture a Purging? I do here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that I have in the firſt months both Vomited and Purged them frequently with Succeſs, and ſo likewiſe Purged (but not Vomited) them after the ſeventh to the very laſt of their Child-bearing, and never did I find any Inconvenience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And doubtleſs, others may do the ſame, if they pleaſe to take pains in fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting remedies of their own for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and by this means free women from thoſe ſorrows which (many of them) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for want of ſuch a neat Aſſiſtance. But be ſure to do it onely with Remedies of your own preparing, which a good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician ſhould alwaies have ready at hand.—The 4. <hi>Aphoriſm</hi> ſaith, Winter is for <hi>Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and that Vomiting ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Summer. Till we have ſome good Reaſon for this ſaying, know that either of them may be done either in Summer or Winter, with good Medicins.—The
5. bids us not Purge before, nor in <pb n="345" facs="tcp:48729:191"/> the
<hi>Dog-daies.—</hi>The 6. and 7. relate to the ſame Buſineſs: But know this, that delicate Vomitories and Purgatives may be given at any Seaſon of the year: yea more than this, I upon occaſion plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Purge my Patients in the Winter, though they keep Shop, or go abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Buſineſs: But this is not to be done by any one that is not Maſter of the like Remedies. Far be it from me to mention this in oſtentation; but I cite every daies experience, to ſhew the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volouſneſs and uſeleſneſs of old Maxims and Medicins.—The 8. forbids Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a
<hi>Conſumption.</hi> But this holds not; in ſom Conſumptions, which are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a recourſe of Serous Matter to the Lungs, nothing is better than ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.—The 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. ſaith, that to Vomit perſons in the Winter that have the Flux called <hi>Lienteria,</hi> is dangerous: And this perhaps might hold true ſtill, if we had no other Vomitories than what he had, ſuch as <hi>white Hellebore, &amp;c.</hi> but know this, that in all Fluxes, nothing brings more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, both in regard of Revulſion and other Reaſons, than a good conditioned Vomit doth in the beginning of Fluxes, at any time of the year: but ſuch violent <pb n="346" facs="tcp:48729:192"/> Vomits as by <hi>Hellebore</hi> and the like Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, of which he ſpeaks afterward in the 13. 14. 15. and 16. Aphoriſms, are not for the work.—The 18. which ſaith if the Patient's pain be above the Midriff, he is to be Vomited; if beneath, then he ought to be Purged, is very fallacious; and particularly, I avow it in the caſe of
<hi>Pleuriſies,</hi> in which moſt Phyſicians do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Rule of this Aphoriſm. The 38. the 39. and the 41. deliver vain Things. One ſaith,
<hi>in what part ſoever moſt Sweat doth appear, there is the ſeat of the Diſeaſe.</hi> Another, <hi>that the part where cold or heat is firſt perceived, is the ſeat of the Diſeaſe.</hi> Another, <hi>that if Cold and Heat by Turns, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently invade the body, it argues the Diſeaſe will be of long continuance:</hi> than all which particulars, our conſtant experience tells us nothing can be more fallacious.—The reſt of the Aphoriſms to the 69. deliver obſervations about Fevers, which ſuit with the Fevers of this Age, as ill as my old Shoes would fit a <hi>Coloſſus;</hi> and ſome of them relate to <hi>Criſes</hi> and <hi>Critical daies,</hi> which we have already thrown out of doors; and certainly with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are theſe things to be ſlighted now, becauſe the whole Scene of Fevers (as
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:48729:192"/> hath been already ſhewn) is exceedingly alter'd; and therefore thoſe Aphoriſms which were calculated for the Meridian of an Age ſo long ſince paſt, may come in faſhion again hereafter, when the
<hi>Platonick year</hi> ſhall, in its revolution, reduce all things to their antient ſtate. And yet ſome of theſe are in part true; but they are thoſe <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> only which deliver the Signes and Tokens of approaching Death, which will be one and the ſame, for the moſt part, to the end of the world.—From the 69. Aphoriſm to the end of this Book, they give Judgment upon Urines; and ſo are very uncertain, as might be made ſufficiently to appear, could I inſiſt upon every Particular. But this being enough, to have run through the four firſt Books of
<hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> I ſuppoſe the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is by this time ſufficiently convinced of their uſeleſneſs, and informed what to gueſs of the three other Books (for, they are ſeven in all;) therefore I avoid them, that I may not be tedious, but do affirm them like the other.</p>
               <p>Now leſt men ſhould turn tail at me, as a perſon ſingular and ſaucy, becauſe I preſume with reaſon, to paſs my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon that which hath been accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <pb n="348" facs="tcp:48729:193"/> the moſt creditable Piece of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſo admired as <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> therefore to ſhew that I am not alone, and that others before me have taken the boldneſs to cenſure him, I will bring in the learned

<hi>cap</hi> 31.</note> Chapter to ſhew, that the Aphoriſms are not of ſuch verity as men have cried them up to be. He takes notice of the 41. Aphoriſm of the fifth Book, which ſaith, <hi>that if a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man take honey'd water, going to bed, and find wringing pains thereupon in her Belly; it is an Argument that ſhe hath conceived with Child: If no pains, then, that ſhe is not with Child:</hi> which though <hi>Galen</hi> endeavors to juſtifie by giving reaſon for it, yet my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor proveth his pretence of reaſon to be of no value, and blames <hi>Avicen</hi> for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the like. And beſides
<hi>Avicen,</hi> he tells of others that have labored hard to ſave the credit of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> about this <hi>Aphoriſm; yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have often tried the Experiment, but could not obſerve any ſuch Pains enſuing.</hi> He tells us alſo, <hi>He denies that an odoriferous Fume received by the genitals of a woman, will, if ſhe be not with child, always penetrate up inwardly to the Noſe;</hi> which is avow'd in one of the Aphoriſms; <hi>becauſe the paſſages of the Womb</hi>

                  <hi>may be cloſed not only by a Conception, but by a falſe Conception, by ſuppreſſed Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, by Fat, by Tumors, and by ſix hundred other Cauſes, as we know by Experience.—</hi>He reproacheth alſo that Aphoriſm which
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Aph.</hi> 42.</note> ſaith, <hi>if a woman with child hath conceived a Male, She is lively coloured in the face, if a Female, then ill-coloured: For, who</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>can defend this Aphoriſm to be alwaies true? How many women have we ſeen ill-coloured, being great with a Male, and well-colour'd with a Female? In the</hi> 31. <hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm likewiſe of the ſixth Book, if a woman with Child be taken with an acute Diſeaſe, it is deadly; who can defend this to me, who have ſeen women ſometimes ſeized with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, and very acute Diſeaſes, and yet they have eſcaped? Moreover, in the</hi> 79. <hi>Aph. of the fourth book, it is ſaid, that ſandy ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of urine be token the Stone in the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: No man of underſtanding would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this, ſeeing ſuch urines have been very often obſerved, without ſuſpicion of the Stone. In like manner in the</hi> 70. <hi>Aphoriſm of the fourth Book, it is ſaid, They whoſe urines appear troubled like the urines of Beaſts, either have pains in the head, or ſhall have; and yet we have ſeen many ſick have ſuch urines, who never had a pain in the head throughout</hi>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:48729:194"/> 
                  <hi>all the time of their ſickneſs.</hi> Ecce quàm Hippocratis ſententiae ſunt aeternae verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis! <hi>Lo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how the ſentences of</hi> Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates <hi>are of eternal verity! Galen</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to ſave the credit of his Leader, would have it thus underſtood, <hi>that though they be not all, yet they are for the moſt part true;</hi> and this excuſe of his is recorded in his Comment on the 58. Aphoriſm of the ſixth Book, which ſaith, <hi>that if the</hi> Omen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum <hi>the Kall ſlip out, it neceſſarily putrefies;</hi> where he ſlubbers over the matter, ſaying, <hi>though it fall out otherwiſe, yet it is in a great part true. But</hi> (ſaith <hi>Sanctorius) conſider the words of</hi> Galen <hi>well which follow,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>when this Aphoriſm and the reſt of them are ſaid to be of eternal verily, it is to be underſtood in a Figurative form of ſpeech that they are ſo, though the very things do not come to paſs:</hi> which is as much as to ſay, that only in a <hi>Figurative Sence</hi> they are true, but in a <hi>real Sence</hi> they are not ſo. And what is this (I pray you) but to give away the Cauſe, and the credit of the Aphoriſms in a fine way of ſpeaking?

                  <q>(Aio te Aeacidem Romanos vincere poſſe)</q> for, men have been exceeding tender of touching them, and mighty careful to ſave the reputation of them, becauſe they were his, who had the luck to be cried up for Prince of the Profeſſion, and it hath been the buſineſs of Commentators ever ſince to hold him up; as if the credit of Phyſick muſt needs fall to the ground, if that man were detected of Error, who in an ignorant Age, impoſed upon the world his own <hi>Dreams,</hi> as matters of

<hi>Index</hi> of the Soul, and gives us, in many Caſes, a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table gueſs at the inward ſtate, yet the Judgments grounded according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions touching the Eye, are every jot as fallacious, as are the common Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks upon Urines; yet upon theſe and the Eye-lids he beſtows two Texts more.—From thence to the 17. Text, he dwells upon the Poſtures of lying in Bed, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of the Hands; and the ſumm of all he ſaith is, that thoſe poſtures and geſtures are beſt which are moſt like the uſual po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of men in health: <hi>Et è contra.</hi> Such Oracles as theſe are obvious, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered at the fire-ſide by every old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that attends the Sick. And yet let me tell you, he that ventures his credit in Prognoſticating upon <hi>poſtures</hi> and
<hi>geſtures,</hi> ſhall aſſuredly give cauſe ever and anon to be laughed at.—The 17. and the 18. tell us, that <hi>in acute Diſeaſes a cold Breath is</hi> 
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:48729:196"/> 
                  <hi>deadly;</hi> and that
<hi>eaſie breathing portends good, but ſhort breathing, and great breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pain and inflammation in the Breſt,</hi> and a <hi>Delirium</hi> at hand; which ſometimes may be ſo, but more often it is not ſo, as we all well know; and I ſhould be loth to be guided by ſuch
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> as theſe in the ordering of a Patient, ſeeing they fall out often, where there is neither <hi>Pain,</hi> nor <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation,</hi> nor a <hi>Delirium</hi> ſubſequent: Eſpecially in <hi>Scorbutick Fevers,</hi> as moſt of the Fevers now extant are. The 18. and 19. are about
<hi>Sweats,</hi> and tell us, thoſe Sweats are beſt which abate the Fever, and that <hi>cold Sweats,</hi> and <hi>partial or imperfect Sweats, are bad:</hi> Thus you ſee all along, that what in theſe
<hi>Prognoſticks</hi> is true is but very ordinary ſtuff.—From the
19. to the end of this Firſt Book, he treats of Abſceſſes or Tumors in the Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in Fevers; which in <hi>acute ones</hi> are ſeldom ſeen, but in other Fevers, and Agues, they ſometimes happen, and but ſometimes; and then uſually when the bodie's habit is vitiated by prepoſterous waies of Curation.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Book of <hi>Prognoſticks,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three Texts ſpent about <hi>Dropſies</hi> (the ſecond whereof is Oraculous, becauſe a <pb n="356" facs="tcp:48729:197"/> Riddle) He tells us in the fourth, that
<hi>if the Head, Hands, and Feet grow cold, while the middle parts burn, tis ill, and that it is beſt, that the whole Bodie ſhould be warm and ſoft.—</hi>The 6. ſaith, <hi>blue or livid Hands and Feet be token Death, and that it is not ſo bad, if they be black,</hi> which two Texts every body will grant, and preach on as well as the beſt Doctor; but the concluſion of the latter, which ſaith, <hi>that if the Patient happen to eſcape with life, yet the parts blackiſh will gangrene,</hi> is moſt falſe.—The 5. is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtuff, which ſaith, <hi>tis good, if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient can turn and rouſe himſelf cheerfully; but dangerous, if he be ſluggiſh.—</hi>In the 7. he is very common likewiſe in his Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtications touching ſleep.—From thence to the 20. he treats of
<hi>Stools,</hi> and out of the cloſe-ſtool Pan he delivers Oracles, which are ſome true, and none of them alwaies true; yea the beſt of them about Stools are not frequently true; but it may be ſo, and it may more often not be ſo; for, tis very often to be ſeen, that the worſer the Stools are which paſs from the Patient, the more relief he receives, and the more ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily he recovers, Nature carrying off that way the Malignant matter of the Diſeaſe.—From thence to the 34. he plaies the

<hi>Vomitings, Spittings, Expectorations,</hi> and <hi>Purulencies;</hi> of which it is certain, that to judge ſo poſitively of a Patients condition by Colours and Conſiſtencies of <hi>Vomits</hi> and <hi>Spittles,</hi> is a very idle thing, ſeeing thoſe which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear worſt do (as we find) very often tend to the beſt: And as for <hi>Purulent Perſons,</hi> it was the Impotency of the old Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which in Diſeaſes of the Cheſt, could not ſo mannage a Cure of them (I inſtance a <hi>Pleuriſie</hi> for one) as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a termination of them in <hi>Puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third Book, the four firſt Texts diſcourſe of
<hi>Criſes</hi> and <hi>Critical</hi> days; of which I have already eaſed the Reader.—The 5. and 6. determine upon what Terms you are to expect
<hi>an eruption of Bloud by the Noſe</hi> after the 20 day of a Fever. But of what uſe is this now? when ſome of us are aſhamed to ſee how long people are held in Fevers under <pb n="358" facs="tcp:48729:198"/> cure, not only till the
20. day, but long after; whereas in fewer days a hopefull account may be given, if at all, except error be committed by the Patient, or his Attendants.—From thence to the 16. treating of <hi>Exulcerations</hi> of the Mouth and Throat, and <hi>Quinſies,</hi> his Doctrin is good.—The
16. relates to <hi>Critical days,</hi> and ſo is not worth the noting.—From thence to the 24. he treats of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceſſes</hi> or
<hi>Tumors</hi> at the Tail of long Fevers and Agues; which are very rare to be ſeen in our days, only in ſome few they ſo fall out.—From thence to the 30. he treats of <hi>Head-ach in Fevers,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>If the Diſeaſe begin with Head-ach, the Patient becomes more afflicted the</hi> 4.
<hi>day than on the</hi> 5. <hi>but is better again on the</hi> 7. Again,
<hi>if the Head begin to ake on the third day of the Fever, then the Patient will be moſt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on the</hi> 5. <hi>but will be freed from the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe on the</hi> 9, <hi>or on the</hi> 11. <hi>day.</hi> Again, <hi>if the Head begin to ake on the</hi> 5. <hi>day then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Criſis on the</hi> 14. all which, he ſaith, holds good in <hi>Continual Fevers,</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Tertians:</hi> But let the Reader ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe Fevers, and he ſhall generally find all this to be fallacious and frivolous. And yet he concludes his Books of Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks <pb n="359" facs="tcp:48729:198"/> with this Magiſterial Aſſertion; that they will be found to prove true in
<hi>Libya,</hi> that is to ſay in the hotteſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and in
<hi>Delos,</hi> i. e. in a temperate Country; and in <hi>Scythia,</hi> i. e. the coldeſt Country; which is as much as to ſay, they will hold certain in all Times and Places, having been ſo Calculated for the Meridian of
<hi>Greece,</hi> his native Country, that they will ſerve indifferently for all Climates and Nations in the world: And this the Commentators will not ſtick to ſwear on the behalf of their great Maſter; though they cannot be ignorant, that things ſeldom fall out ſo<hi>:</hi> but the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon old Notions muſt be held up, and there is the Buſineſs; If we recede from old Things, and ſuffer a reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any (ſaid the Council of
<hi>Trent)</hi> it will take off all reverence to the reſt: I ſhall not apply it to the Concernments of Phyſick, but leave impartial men to judge, whether ſome Profeſſors Intereſts, and Ignorance alſo, may not lie in the way of ſo neceſſary a work, as reforming and redeeming of ſo Noble a Profeſſion; and what Credit is to be given to one that contradicts himſelf, I mean this <hi>our great Maſter,</hi> who forgot that the 19. Aphoriſm of his ſecond Book conſutes all <pb n="360" facs="tcp:48729:199"/> that he delivers here as certain about Acute Diſeaſes; for there he ſaith, that the <hi>Predictions concerning ſuch Diſeaſes are uncertain.</hi> And whereas he hath ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periouſly ſaid, that his <hi>Prognoſticks</hi> will hold certain in all Countrys, I note it clearly contradicts the reaſon of his

I am ſory I have grated ſo hard upon this buſineſs, but it cannot be avoided: It is no more than what ſome of the more ingenious ſort of men have been aiming at before; only, becauſe in thoſe days it was not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to diſcredit the old Learning, when they had no better to ſubſtitute in the room of it, therefore they endeavoured to ſalve all ſores, and touch them very tenderly; but I ſay,

And yet not ſo, as to caſt them off wholy; for there is uſe of them in a degree, and of their Commentators, as there is of old Poſts and Stones, though it be but to ſhew where the old Road was, and how we may be take our ſelves to better waies, by comparing it with the new.</p>

And as there are many other things by him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, which as Cauſes contribute to the turning of Wine to Vinegar; ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt he tells us, it may be done by caſting a little <hi>Ferment,</hi> that is <hi>leven</hi> or leavened bread, into it, which by degrees turns the Wine into its own acrimonious acid Nature. The ſame alſo is done, when an ill <hi>Scorbutick Ferment</hi> comes any way into that generous liquor the Bloud, and turns it to an acid ichorous acrimonious ſtate and condition: for a vitious Ferment, as well as crude and ſharp humors, will corrupt the Maſs of Bloud. Moreover, if by any Accident, as Heat, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, Wine happen to loſe its <hi>Sulphur,</hi> that is, its Sulphureous or Balſamick part (it being apt to evaporate) then it turns likewiſe to Vinegar: After the ſame manner alſo it fares with the Bloud when its <hi>Balſamy Part</hi> is evaporated by Fevers, immoderate Heats, Sorrows, Studies, <pb n="376" facs="tcp:48729:207"/> Watchings, Exerciſes, or Venery, the corroſive Salty parts left behind predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and ſo pervert the Maſs into ſuch a ſharp condition, that it can be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to nothing more fitly than to Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>

               <p>This acid ſtate of the blood, as to the manner of its generation, is very well il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by our learned Countriman Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor

<hi>Quartan,</hi> wherein he ſaith that the liquor of the Bloud <hi>in naturam Ponticam &amp; aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuſculam degenerat,</hi> degenerates into a ſour auſtere acid nature. And a little before he deſcribes it thus,

               <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place, I would have this agreed on alſo; that the main cauſe of this acid ſtate of the Bloud is an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or a decay of its <hi>Sulphur and Spirit:</hi> This appears by

                  <hi>Sennertus,</hi> who ſaith, <pb n="378" facs="tcp:48729:208"/> that generous liquor, Wine, is wont to become acid, when that principle the <hi>Sulphur</hi> is for the moſt part gone from the <hi>Salt,</hi> either by evaporation or otherwiſe, and ſo that principle the <hi>Salt</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was Volatile, and friendly, becomes fixt, and acrimonious or acid: which is the true cauſe of Vinegar<hi>:</hi> which appears plain enough by putting flame to Vinegar, for, it will not burn, becauſe the Sulphur is abſent, and the Winy Spirit extinct, or depreſſed. This is ſeconded by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Doctor,
<note n="*" place="margin">Willis <hi>de Febr. ca</hi> 6.</note> who ſaith, that the evaporation of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> out of mens bloud, occaſioned through the heat of the Summer, is one reaſon why men in Autumn have that acid ſtate of bloud, which renders them lyable to
<hi>Quartan</hi> Agues, and the <hi>Scurvy;</hi> which is not to be reſtored by any other means, than by dulcifying it; that is, by altering it with ſuch Medicins and Meats, as may impregnate it anew with an amicable <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt,</hi> and a Balſamick Sulphur and Spirit: Juſt ſo as Wines, when they are growing acid, or flat and vapid, are not to be reſtored any other way, than by feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with Fleſh, and rich Syrups, and freſh Lees, or other things that <pb n="379" facs="tcp:48729:208"/> abound with a <hi>Sulphureous</hi> and
<hi>Spirituous</hi> nature.</p>

That as the Blood in Perſons of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten contracts an acid ſtate, ſo likewiſe in Scorbutick and other ill-affected bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, it at length, after the manner of Wine, degenerates ſo far, as to grow <hi>vapid, flat and dead,</hi> being deveſted of its <hi>Balſamick Sulphureous and Spirituous</hi> part, in a further degree.

               <p n="1">I. That we ought to be very wary of drawing bloud in our Climate, in regard of the univerſal ſpreading of the <hi>Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Tincture:</hi> For, I am perſwaded, more than half of the Sick do ſuffer upon this Account, in theſe Northerly Nations; as is cleared pretty well in the foregoing part of this Book, it being an undoubted Truth, that the
<hi>Scurvy</hi> is predominating in moſt of our Diſeaſes, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we have much more of a crude <hi>acid Serum</hi> floating in the Maſs of Bloud, than is uſual in the more delicate Climates, where that Diſeaſe is but rarely found; and this, becauſe, beſides the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Adventitious Cauſes, our blood is in its own nature much more Dilute and Serous. This you have well Diſcourſed by an eminent Profeſſor of one of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of <hi>Germany,</hi> by name
<hi>Auguſtinus Thonerus,</hi> one that I find to have been in great eſteem with <hi>Greg. Horſtius,</hi> and with all the famous Phyſicians of that time; who having declared his own

<hi>Obſ.</hi> 33.</note> Judgement againſt bleeding in the Fevers of the Northern Climates, adds to his own alſo <pb n="384" facs="tcp:48729:211"/> the Teſtimony of <hi>Zacutus Luſ.</hi> in theſe words: <hi>It cannot be amiſs here to recite what is ſaid by</hi> Zacutus <hi>in his</hi> Obſervations <hi>touching the Bloud of the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>and of the</hi> Germans, <hi>which is moſt worthy to be known and noted,</hi> viz.
<hi>That in the bodies of</hi> Spaniards <hi>there abounds a bloud thick, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent, and compact, ſo that if they be ſeized by a Continual Fever, they all die, unleſs there intervene a large letting out of bloud. On the contrary, the bodies of the</hi> Germans <hi>are filled with bloud crude, watery, and not very firm or compact. If in Fevers the bloud which is drawn from a</hi> Spaniard <hi>be fluid and watery, ſo that it do not thicken with stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is an undoubted ſign, known even to Idiots, that they all die, becauſe the Fibres of the bloud are corrupt and diſſolved: But in</hi> Germany, <hi>not only in malignant Fevers, but even in the leſſer Diſeaſes, and ſickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the bloud, though fluid and watery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth no danger. Hereupon it comes to paſs, that the</hi> Germans
<hi>do hardly bear bloud-letting, eſpecially if it be large, becauſe their bloud is leſs Spirituous; as is evident by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, in regard, that if we in health be let bloud, merely for prevention of a Diſeaſe, we very often fall into grievous Faintings, even while the blood is flowing: Much more</hi>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:48729:211"/> 
                  <hi>then is it to be feared in Continual Fevers. The nature of the</hi> Iralians <hi>differs not much from the conſtitution of the</hi> Spaniards; <hi>and the complexion of the</hi> French <hi>is firy, ſo that they may have greater need of eventilation by bleeding. Wherefore, things thus ſtanding, it were</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a Phyſicians beſt courſe to uſe providence and caution in this matter, and to accommodate his counſel according to the diverſity of Countries, Reaſon and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhewing him the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this be the ſtate of the bloud of the <hi>Germans,</hi> from whom we <hi>Engliſh</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and who live in a Northern Clime not much different from theirs, certainly what is true in this caſe of them, muſt needs very much concern us: The bloud of us both is much alike, as to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous part, becauſe moſt of the Sick in both Countries have their ſouls even drowned in a Floud of Serous and Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick humors within the Veins, whoſe acidity and acrimony ſhews, after the manner of Vinegar, that the Spirits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained are either very few, or very much depreſſed. I would fain know then, whether in opening Veins that contain ſo much of an <hi>acid Serum,</hi> and ſo little of the noble <hi>Crimſon liquor,</hi> it be not a great <pb n="386" facs="tcp:48729:212"/> hazard to let out ſo great a part of the <hi>Crimſon</hi> as appears in every Phlebotomy, becauſe in it the Vital Spirits abound, and it is as it were the balſam of the bloud, ſo that the ſubtracting of but a little muſt of neceſſity leave the reſt behind much more lyable to dilution and corruption, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſuperabundance of the Serous acid Humors, and therefore the leſs able to give a Tincture and nature of bloud to the new Chyle which ſucceeds; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, it not being duly aſſimilated and Sanguified, inſtead of being converted into good bloud, doth degenerate, and add to the Floud of Crudities and Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to the further diſabling of the bodie at preſent, and a diſpoſing it for the future to worſe Diſeaſes, and a languiſhing life, which is worſe than Death. How many every year are ſeen upon this Account, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to ſuffer! when Phyſicians up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every ſlight Motion or Ebullition of Humors, are immediately for opening a Vein, the conſequence whereof is, for the moſt part, a diſpoſing of the Limbs to Numbedneſs, and Stiches, Aches, Prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Arthritick and Nephritick pains, and Agues and Fevers, debility of Stomack, and of all the Bowels, Gravel and wind-Colick, <pb n="387" facs="tcp:48729:212"/> all manner of Hypochondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack paſſions, and the haſtning on of old Age, through the continual heaping up of Crudities, becauſe Nature, loſing much of Vital power in every opening of a Sluce (on which power the validity of all the Ferments of the Parts and Veſſels (which are the great Elaborators) the work of Concoction doth ſolely depend) is not able to give the Succeeding Chyle and Bloud its due Digeſtion and Vitality. Tis to be granted, that at the firſt, our Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick Patients ſeem to come off with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, the diminution and eventilation of the liquor by Phlebotomy, putting a ſtop to the high boyling, and ſo there follows a Pacification, and hence it is that the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian ſeems to deſerve praiſe for it; but alas the relief is but fraudulent and temporary, the body pays for it afterward, being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by expoſed to greater exaſperations and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullitions, upon the acceſs of every extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Adventitious heat, and exotick ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritating Spirit, when the Natural Heat and Spirits are by loſs of Bloud made weak and low: the truth of which is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſeen in the leſs Vegete, or the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letudinary ſtate of Bodies, eſpecially if they abound with thoſe acid and acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:48729:213"/> Juices. What a horrid thing is it to ſee, how freely many times bloud is drawn in the beginning of Agues, Fevers, and Arthritick Diſtempers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of quelling the immoderate Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the Maſs, whenas there are ſo many other waies to the Wood? but admit there were not, yet certainly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome purgation by Specificks might be much more proper in ſuch habited Bodies; for, even this, if the Medicin be right, gives as preſent relief, and without the like hazard; it drains the ill humors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diminiſhing the Crimſon Balſam and Vital Spirit, which departs and vaniſheth (more or leſs) upon every Section of the Veins and Eventation of the Bloud (as ſome do call it.)

Now I know, there are many Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions brought out of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and
<hi>Galen</hi> to the contrary, preferring Phlebotomy as a more ſafe remedy than Purging. To which I ſay, whatever <hi>Hippocrates</hi> might do in
<hi>Greece,</hi> or <hi>Galen</hi> who practiſed in <hi>Greece</hi> and
<hi>Rome,</hi> by way of bleeding, is no example for us, not only in regard of the difference of Climates, but in reſpect alſo of the Alteration of Time and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes themſelves: And there is this likewiſe conſiderable in the Caſe, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was acquainted with no evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators but
<hi>Hellebore</hi> and ſuch like violent ſtuff; and <hi>Galen</hi> knew only the like, and ill-corrected <hi>Scammoniates,</hi> ſharp and firy, ſuch as ſet Nature upon the rack; and therefore they had ſome reaſon, practiſing in ſo delicate Climates, in a leſs Tainted Age, to preferr Bleeding as a more ſafe remedy than purging; but what is that to us in the Northern world, at this time, <pb n="390" facs="tcp:48729:214"/> where the ſtates of men and Diſeaſes, as well as Climates, are quite other things, and on whom God hath beſtowed a better Furniture of Remedies? Truly, beſides theſe reaſons, there is ſo much the leſs Cauſe to heed what <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith about this matter, becauſe as in many other things, ſo in this he hath the luck to be ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory, as all heady quarelſom ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Writers are wont to be; for, in his Comment on 2. <hi>Aph.</hi> 19. he extolls Blooding as a ſafe remedy before Purging; and on the contrary 2.
<hi>Acut.</hi> 11. He mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Purgation before Bleeding: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if in thoſe Countries and Times it was a meaſuring Caſt, that he could not readily conclude which to ſide with as beſt and ſafeſt, then the preference of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be admitted without queſtion by us now, having ſo many new meaſures of Reaſon to preponderate and invalidate the old. What a marvelous hazard then muſt we needs run by longer relying upon Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenick Doctrin, and exotick practiſes learn't abroad, and brought home by ſome pretending Doctors? who return perchance with little more than a
<hi>Diploma</hi> and forein Twattle, to trie Concluſions upon our Countrimen by ſtrange Notions <pb n="391" facs="tcp:48729:214"/> and Cuſtoms, not at all agreeable to the Conſtitutions of our Bodies; eſpecially by the bold way of bleeding, which Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Familes are bound to curſe; and this Cuſtom is the more confidently owned by Travellers, becauſe beſides their Obſervations beyond-Sea, their Phantſies are heightned with old Galenick Authorities; eſpecially in Fevers and all acute Diſeaſes promiſcuouſly; For, in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and moſt Agues, bloud is drawn of courſe, becauſe

                  <hi>Averroes,</hi> the moſt judicious Author among the <hi>Arabians.</hi> But this manner of Practiſe will appear ſo much the more intolerable, if we go to ſenſible experiment; for, in bloud-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſuppoſe that Ten ounces be drawn, you will have ſometimes 4.5. or perhaps 7. ounces of Humors, the reſidue good bloud; now the loſs of but a little good bloud more concerns the Body as to damage, than the evacuation of the concurrent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors by Phlebotomy can advantage it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the more Cacochymy or ill juice is contained in the Veins, ſo much the <pb n="392" facs="tcp:48729:215"/> more reaſon there is, not to part with any part of the Crimſon liquor, though never ſo ſmall, becauſe in it the Vital power is lodged to carry on the work of future Sanguification; and the Diminution of any part of it is but a diſabling of what remains behind. Now in Purgation, the Caſe is much otherwiſe; for, though <hi>Helmont</hi> ſay Purgatives do but corrupt the Bloud and Humors into that ſtinking ſtate, and then draw them away, yet he muſt be underſtood of thoſe <hi>deleterious venemous Purgers</hi> in common uſe; whereas new ones are found, and more may be found out, which will drain the Veins of their vitious humors in an amicable manner, and leave the bloud behind purified from its own impurities, and untainted with any exotick Ferment contracted from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicin: which work being done without ſtraining or offenſive irritation of Nature, the Fermentation or Ebullition in Acute Diſeaſes ceaſeth of its ſelf without any more ado. But if Purgation will not do, there are next to be uſed other means to pacifie, with much more effect and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than by Phlebotomy, which alwaies rids away a portion of the Sulphur, the Balſamick and Spirituous part of the <pb n="393" facs="tcp:48729:215"/> bloud; which if kept within the Body, would conduce to a more quick over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and pacifying of the abundance of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line acid Humors, which are floating in the Veines of moſt perſons that are ill-habited, or Scorbutically inclined For,</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be true (as I have before ſhewn) that a decay of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Spirituous</hi> part of any liquor, is the cauſe of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming crude and acid, and if thereupon alſo the Salty part become extravagant for want of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain and attemper it; it is plain likewiſe in the bloud, that the Balſamick Sulphur and Spirituous part thereof being but little, and leſs in our Northern Bodies than thoſe of other Climates, it muſt be a pernicious courſe that ſhall offer to make it leſs; for (as I have hinted already) every little part drawn away leaves the remainder in the Veins leſs able to allay or ſweeten the acrimony of thoſe acid and Saline Humors which are aſſociated therewith. This is the Cauſe, why <hi>Fevers,</hi> and
<hi>Agues,</hi> in theſe parts of the world, uſually fare ill upon bleeding; for, though for ſome hours after perhaps there ſeem to be ſome abatement, yet commonly preſently the Diſeaſe becomes thereby more fierce and <pb n="394" facs="tcp:48729:216"/> difficulty curable; the ſtrength Spirits and Balſam (which ſhould help to qualifie and conquer the Morbifick matter) being more abated than the Feveriſh Cauſe, or its Diſtemper.</p>

                  <hi>That drawing of Bloud is</hi> (ſaith he)

<pb n="401" facs="tcp:48729:219"/> there remains no more room for the like palliatory proceeding. Which leads me to a diſquiſition upon the third <hi>Preliminary Point;</hi> and that is the <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, flat, inſipid, dead ſtate of the Bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Now if there be ſuch a flat, vapid, Spiritleſs ſtate of Bloud (as we ſuppoſe, may be) that is to ſay, not abſolutely ſuch, but in an analogical Comparative Sence, (for, ſo it may be ſaid to be, if compared with that florid Vegete vigorous condition which ought to be;) then ſurely it will be yielded, that in ſuch a Caſe, <hi>letting bloud</hi> muſt needs be exceeding pernicious: For, the leſs of the nobler vital bloud is in the Maſs, the more miſchievous it is to part with any part of that little, foraſmuch as in all openings of Veins a conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Crimſon liquor comes along with the other, and leaves the remaining Maſs the more Spiritleſs and deſtitute. In any liquor, as the loſs of the <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and a depreſſion of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> cauſeth it grow acid and acrimonious; ſo a diminution, evaporation, deſtitution or deprivation of Spirits, cauſeth it to grow vapid, or (as we call it in Engliſh) <hi>flat and dead.</hi> This holds true likewiſe in the Liquor of the Veines: It may be concluded therefore, that when
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:48729:220"/> it is brought to ſuch a Paſs, or in any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that lead a Courſe of life which muſt of neceſſity bring it to that paſs, we ought to be very careful to avoid the breathing of a Vein (as they call it) or rather the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of the Spirituous liquor, which is that which gives life and vigor to the whole Maſs, ſo farr as it is capable thereof.</p>
               <p>The perſons uſually reduced to ſuch a Paſs as this are theſe,</p>
               <p>Such Scorbutick perſons, and the <hi>Pocky,</hi> as have much of thoſe Ferments either He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary, or elſe long ſetled and inveterated within them through ill Diet, or by ways of Contagion <hi>Mediate</hi> or
<hi>Immediate</hi> long contracted; for, nothing eclypſeth the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Ethereal Vital Spirit, and by that means depauperates the bloud more than the poyſonous Ferments of theſe Maſter-Maladies; and this is viſible enough in thoſe ſo Tainted, that have not by nature ſo ſtrong a conſtitution of Body to reſiſt the operative power and influence of the ſame Ferments, as ſome other Tainted perſons have; for, in the weighing of all theſe Reaſons you are to add <hi>a grain of Salt,</hi> that is, you are to give ſome allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, according to the condition of the Patients; but be it what it will, Bleeding <pb n="403" facs="tcp:48729:220"/> doth alwaies bring detriment; and by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent repetition of it, the Venom lodged in the other parts of the Maſs gains the greater opportunity to ſhew it ſelf, and by ſuch errors, it at length acquires a Dominion, even in the ſtrongeſt perſons, over the whole habit of the Body; and then they are reduced to the ſame viſible Inconveniences and damages, which are wont to enſue the bleeding of thoſe other Tainted perſons that are by nature of a more weakly Frame. But the ſum of this Buſineſs is, that in theſe Caſes, where any thing of thoſe Contagious or Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Ferments lurks, Bleeding doth hurt more or leſs, though ſenſibly and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome more than in others; and this I obſerve, that when perſons Tainted are ſeized with quick Agues, or Fevers, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acute Diſeaſes, which ever bring the ſtrongeſt Conſtitutions down to a weakly ſtate, the drawing of bloud draws a miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Train of Conſequents after it. Which hath brought me to this Reſolution, and I hope it will work upon others, ſeeing the
<hi>Venereous,</hi> and <hi>Scorbutick</hi> Ferments are grown ſo univerſal, never to open a Vein but when there is a very great urgency, or elſe a neceſſity for immediate ſaving of a <pb n="404" facs="tcp:48729:221"/> life, or upon ſome other extraordinary occaſions; which are apprehended well enough by judicious Phyſicians, and it is not proper to my deſigne, who affect bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, here to recite them, and who have taken upon me, only to diſcover the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of compriſing Phlebotomy within the compaſs of a common Formal Method, as it was of old, in order to the curation of moſt Diſeaſes; whenas all Conſtitutions of men and Diſeaſes in this Age do (as I have pretty well manifeſted) participate more or leſs of the aforementioned <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and their Blouds are by the <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Venoms</hi> contained in them, more or leſs vapid, diſ-ſpirited and impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or apt to be ſo upon any ſmall Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that way tending.</p>
               <p>Next to the perſons Scorbutically and Venereouſly Tainted, I may reckon thoſe that are immoderate in the exerciſe of Simple Venery; for, exceſs this way wonderfully exhauſteth the Spirits, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries away as it were the Flower, and moſt balſamick part of the Alimentary Juice, to the defrauding of the Maſs of bloud of its nobleſt ſupply; ſo that it ſoon grows acid and acrimonious, and by degrees Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritleſs, Vapid, and Inſipid. Such perſons <pb n="405" facs="tcp:48729:221"/> as theſe are very lyable to Fevers; and if they happen to be ſeized therewith, or any other Diſeaſe, the opening of a Veine brings ſuch damage as is ſcarce to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved likewiſe, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons given to exceſs of Wine, or ſtrong Waters, or other Tiplings, do in tract of time loſe the noble native Heat of the body, and the Spirituous Balſamick part of the bloud comes to evaporate and ſpend it Self, by being infeſted with an extraneous preternatural Heat, and with Crudities; and ſo the Maſs becomes as vapid by this way of intemperance as any other.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid concerning people of <hi>a ſorrowful Frame of Heart,</hi> or that are broken in their Fortunes, who are uſually ſick in mind rather then Body, and the mind diſorders the body. Be their Diſeaſe what it will, I never ſaw them proſper with bleeding; or with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evacuations upward, or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if violent, or frequent.</p>
               <p>To theſe add alſo perſons who are of little or no appetite to Feeding, or that have an ill Concoction; for, their liquor within the Veines muſt needs be very live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, <pb n="406" facs="tcp:48729:222"/> crude and vapid, ſeeing the Chyle comes to them imperfectly cocted; This is very well noted alſo by Doctor <hi>Willis</hi>

<hi>Willis</hi> of late, calls <hi>coagulated</hi> and <hi>congeled,</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wherever this ſtate of bloud is found, the reaſon holds very ſtrong here likewiſe againſt the opening of a Veine.

<hi>Helmont</hi> doth wiſely determine; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently whether in our daies, Fevers by the direction of thoſe <hi>Maligne</hi> and <hi>Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Fermenss,</hi> have not changed their uſual Quarters in the Veins, Arteries, and Bowels, and taken up new ones in the <hi>Nervoſum genus,</hi> the Brain and Nervous parts; and ſo whether the main battel in contending againſt them ought not to be maintained by <hi>Alexipharmacal Remedies,</hi> others than thoſe in common uſe, and ſuch as are more appropriate to the Nature of thoſe Fermental Venoms, rather than by Bleeding and other evacuations? He who obſerves in theſe daies, almoſt in every Fever, yea and in Agues, what little Spaſms, Vellications, Convulſive Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Tremblings, Stupors, Rigors, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, drowſie and delirious Symptoms, and the like diſtempers incident to the Nervous parts, are attending, and much more frequently than in former time, will eaſily grant, that Fevers do for the moſt part ſettle in the liquor of the Brain, and of its Nervous Appendants; and ſo that Bloud-letting, ſerving only to debilitate perſons, becauſe it cannot reach the <pb n="419" facs="tcp:48729:228"/> offending Cauſe, muſt needs be out of Doors, together with the ordinary lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid Julips and Cordials of the Shops. To ſay no more of this, I have been very much confirmed in my Judgement, by obſerving the Practiſe of one who is no Academian, but an antient Practiſer, of a good Inſight into Nature, and exceeding dextrous and Succeſsful in curing Fevers (a grand multitude daily flocking to him) and yet he draws no bloud, and very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom uſeth other evacuation than by breathing Sweats, procured by the uſe of Alexipharmacal means, ſuch as oppoſe Malignity, and by diſſolving, or diſcuſſing the coagulated or gellied portions of the Maſs of bloud, do reſtore the bloud into a due courſe of Circulation, and preſerve it ſo, till the Malignity be ſubdued, and diſſipated <hi>per Diaphoreſin,</hi> that is to ſay in
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> by a breathing forth or tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration through the Skin. And what is ſaid here againſt Blooding in Fevers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is by a parity of Reaſon applicable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Acute Diſeaſes; yea and much more to thoſe that are <hi>Chronical,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Coagulations</hi> and <hi>Congelations</hi> here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed are moſt frequent in them, by reaſon of the acrimonious Crudities and <pb n="420" facs="tcp:48729:229"/> Acidities which in theſe daies are in Vogue among them. Nevertheleſs, where Cuſtomary evacuations of bloud by <hi>Menſtruals, Haemorrhoids,</hi> and the like, are ſuppreſſed; or if Patients have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten uſed to Bloud-letting for their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, ſomewhat may, in ſuch caſes, be indulged to neceſſity and cuſtom, but not without the good conſideration and care of a wiſe wary Phyſician.</p>

If it be true, which the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and induſtrious Inquirers of this Age do now hold, that in the work of Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, it is the Bloud which makes Bloud; <hi>viz.</hi> that the power of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Chyle or Alimentary Juice into new Bloud, depends upon the goodneſs and the validity of the old Maſs, which is ſuppoſed to give it the true Tincture and Tranſmutation, then the drawing forth of the

Therefore it will be very much to the purpoſe alſo, here to cite <pb n="421" facs="tcp:48729:229"/> what is delivered by the ſame Doctor in ſeveral places, to ſhew, that ſuch a ſtate of Blood is prevalent in the cauſation of moſt Fevers, and thereupon to argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Bleeding in that caſe.

                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:48729:230"/>
                  <hi>and the Returns of it are not taken off, till the offending Juice be removed out of the Body.</hi> To this Sence is much of that Chapter, and he repeats it in his <hi>ſixth Chapter</hi> when he comes to treat of
<hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Agues;</hi> which may be applied alſo to moſt other Agues, becauſe though they have another Type and Formality, yet they have much of the Nature of a <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> by reaſon of the Scorbutick Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties predominant in them more than here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and that is the main reaſon why they are all become as difficult to be cured now, as <hi>Quartans</hi> were of old; ſo that drawing of Bloud and other Evacuations are as little to be allowed in them, as in the Quartans; wherein the learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſaith,
<hi>Evacuators do not procure one jot of advantage, but rather by depauperating the Bloud, deſtroy the ſtrength;</hi> whereas the right way to cure is, to reduce the Maſs from its crude acid ſtate, by ſuch reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as will
<hi>new Spirit the bloud, and volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, there is this to be ſaid tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the different effects of Bleeding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Northern and the finer parts of the world; They bear it much better, becauſe their bloud is endued naturally
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:48729:230"/> with a greater plenty of Spirits, than ours, and hath leſs of that <hi>Seroſa Colluvies</hi> with which the Northern men do abound; ſo that in the more delicate Countries when Bloud is drawn, thoſe Spirits which are loſt thereby are, becauſe of their plenty, better ſpared, and ſooner repaired; partly by the benignity of the Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive Air, and partly (yea eſpecially) by the notable power of <hi>Aſsimilation</hi> which is in their Bloud, much beyond others; which quickly ſupplies them with Bloud again, becauſe there is not in their Veins ſuch a Floud of acid and vapid Seroſities to drown and pervert the new Chyle, ſo as thereby to hinder the work of Aſſimilating it to the ſtock of Bloud which remains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; and therefore it is, that as they bear the loſs better, in regard of a greater ſtore of Spirits, ſo the reparation of the ſtock of Bloud and Spirits is much quicker, in regard of the more ſure and ſpeedy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of Sanguification. Now in the <hi>Northern Climates,</hi> eſpecially in a cloudy dripping Iſland, as ours is, where the Air is not ſo impregnated with clear luminous Ethereal and Spirituous Atoms, as theirs is, and conſequently not ſo near of kin to the Spirit of man; as it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:48729:231"/> here ſhould be ſo great a plenty of Spirits in our bloud; ſo likewiſe it is but reaſonable (which is obſerved by Writers) that our Maſs of bloud ſhould be floated with a greater quantity of Crude Seroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and conſequently that we ſhould be not ſo able to bear Bleeding, becauſe of the paucity of Spirits; nor ſo likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair what Bloud is loſt, becauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder hath leſs power to aſſimilate and Sanguifie the ſucceeding Alimentary Juice or Chyle. So that conſider the different flate of the generality of men in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Climates and Countries, and we ſee there is reaſon why they ſhould generally approve Bleeding, and be relieved; and why we ſhould have a general Averſation to it, ſo as not to permit the practiſe of it to be ſo general and cuſtomary, as in more delicate Airs and Countries, when we daily ſee it ſo deſtructive in our own. Away then with thoſe Maxims and Methods of the Antients about Phlebotomy, which were calculated for the practiſe of another Climate: And yet I deny not but ſome particular Caſes may require it here; only the Cuſtomarineſs and commonneſs of the thing ought to be exploded.

                  <hi>The Spirits of men</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are variouſly affected by Aliments, and by the external Air; from whence it comes to paſs, that thoſe people which inhabit the cold parts of the world, by reaſon of their Denſe or groſs Spirits, which flow from a thick Bloud, are ſtout and formidable, and fearleſs of danger,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Aſiaticks and ſuch other finer Nations, have a finer bloud and Spirits,</hi> &amp;c.

On the other ſide, we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more groſs Spirits, by reaſon of the thickneſs and foggineſs of our Air, and of our Bloud, thoſe Spirits of ours are not ſo eaſily diſſipated, and remain ſtrong even after action; but becauſe when we loſe our bloud and Spirits together by Bleeding, they are not ſo eaſily or ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly repairable, in regard of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Serous (yea and groſs) Crudities which alwaies float in the Maſs, more than in warmer and clearer Countries; <pb n="426" facs="tcp:48729:232"/> therefore it is, that though we be more ſtout and valiant in Acting, and will fight in bloud to the laſt, when others ſhrink and fail, yet afterwards we generally feel more damage by loſs of Bloud, than the other are wont to do.—But yet after all this,
'tis reported of the <hi>Turks,</hi> that though they live in thoſe delicate Quarters of the Earth, they uſe not <hi>Bleeding,</hi> but are cured of their Diſeaſes without it: which cauſeth wonder, that other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (as the

Indeed, if you keep to the Doctrin, you muſt hold to the Medicins; and if you uſe the Medicins, you muſt proceed in the Method, according to that Heatheniſh Galenick Doctrin. For, tis true, that <hi>An error in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation cannot be amended in the Superſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture:</hi> If the trifling Notions of <hi>Elements, Qualities, Temperaments, Complexions,</hi> &amp;c. be out of doors, what remains then, but to pray, that the crude, ſulſom, ill-condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Meſſes and Mixtures, and Liquors, which are fitted to thoſe Notions, may be thrown out of doors alſo? And if
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:48729:234"/> there be ſo great an Alteration of Diſeaſes (as I have proved) and they proceeding (for the moſt part) from new Cauſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Antients, and of a much more myſterious Nature than formerly, (great Alterations having fallen out in the narrow Compaſs of twenty years paſt) what remains but that we ought to think alſo of another way of
<hi>Pharmacie,</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of new Medicins; and not to deſtroy Apothecaries, but to rectifie and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them? As the Caſe now ſtands with them, they are under a miſerable drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (and I have heard ſome of them ſigh at it) that Cuſtom prevailing for the uſe of ſo many Horrid Electuaries, Lohocs, ſtrange contrived Pills, crude Droſſie Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups, endleſs varieties of unguents, and Plaſters, moſt of which are uſeleſs (and were they meliorated would yet be of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle uſe) they are obliged to drudge and toil to have all theſe things in readineſs, or elſe they muſt loſe their Cuſtomers; and if they have not Cuſtomers enough to take them off, they muſt ſtand and periſh upon their hands; whereas if theſe were mended by preparation, and reduced to a very ſmall number; or rather if the ſtream of their employment were turned, <pb n="431" facs="tcp:48729:234"/> by putting them upon a <hi>Materia Medica</hi> formed for the moſt part in the noble way of Chymical Preparation, they might, without that great ado which is made eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year, provide themſelves in one year for ſeven or more years, of Medicins not lyable to corruption, and in the uſage, of much more advantage and pleaſure to their Patients. In the mean while, 'tis pitty to ſee ſo many ingenious men as are of that Profeſſion, one of the worthy Companies of this great City, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as it were to a Trade much like the Confectioners; the greateſt part of which are, as things now ſtand, expoſed to a Temptation to exceed their uſual Bounds, and to relieve themſelves, renounce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to their Galenick Maſters; in which courſe, it is humbly ſubmitted to better Judgement, whether they do right to their Friends and Countrimen, or not; and whether a Toleration may not be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them to preſerve themſelves from ruine, till there be more proper Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins and Medicins inſtituted, in order to the practiſe of Phyſick; for, what uſe can there be of that piece of ſtate the mere
<hi>Scholaſtick Doctor,</hi> when the Apothecary ſometimes muſt direct him, and at all <pb n="432" facs="tcp:48729:235"/> times, as well, if not better, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the Medicins, than he that ſeldom hath ſeen the making of a Medicin? or why ſhould the ſick be put to a double Charge for their cure, when as a common knowledge of the uſe of common Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins is likely to render them more effectual in the hands of an Apothecary, that uſeth them in ſuch a Method as his own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Mother-wit will direct him, than in the hands or by the Preſcript of ſuch a <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular Doctor,</hi> as follows only that erroneous Method hitherto commended by the Schools? For my part, were I in a ſick condition, and ignorant of the Art of Phyſick, and were there a neceſſity that I muſt ſubmit to a Cure in the old way of means, I would rather commit my ſelf into the hands of a prudent Apothecary, or of any prudent Practiſer that is no Scholar, than venture my life at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of any other Practiſer that pedantical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pins himſelf up to the old Scholaſtick Learning and Medicins; becauſe he that is no <hi>formal Doctor</hi> will probably follow his own obſervation and experience, as he finds things alter'd in the Age and Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate wherein he lives, and ſo may hit on a cure, becauſe he projects to himſelf ſuch <pb n="433" facs="tcp:48729:235"/> Means and Method, as ſeem agreeable to ſuuh Alteration; whereas a
<hi>Doctor</hi> that is inſpired with the Divinity of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> having heard them boaſt in their Books, that their Maxims and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are little leſs than infallible, and will hold ſo, in all Ages and Countries, to the end of the world, uſually comes with thoſe narrow antiquated Notions to the management of a Cure, and ſo muſt needs miſs the mark, becauſe things are otherwiſe now (though he will not believe it) than they were in the daies of old, or in the Countries of
<hi>Greece, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> from whence the common Oracles and Compoſitions are tranſmitted to us. Therefore doubtleſs the Apothecaries have reaſon to deſire Favor in order to their Support and Maintenance; and the Sick, in many Caſes, may with reaſon make uſe of the one, as well as, or without the other: And, admitt there be a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (as there ſeems to be) of other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins and Medicins in this Age and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the world, then certainly if the <hi>Dogmatick Phyſicians</hi> will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, the Apothecaries have reaſon to leave them, and betake themſelves more fully to the Study of Chymical Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:48729:236"/> and Chymical Preparations; and tis adviſable for them to fall upon this courſe betimes, if they mean to preſerve their Trade, becauſe now adaies Princes, and Nobles generally apprehend the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, gentleneſs, pleaſantneſs and mighty power of Medicins ſo prepared, and what a Fulſomneſs and Inſufficiency there is in the other: So that while it gains ground every day among the ingenious part of men, it is eaſie to foreſee what the ſtate of Phyſick will be after twenty years more are paſt, when Death ſhall have diſpoſed of ſome few Practitioners, that are (as they think) too old and wiſe to learn better things.</p>
               <p>Tis not to be preſumed I can be an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to a company of men ſo conſiderable, and of ſo great ingenuity as the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries, becauſe I wiſh a Reformation of their Shops, that they may be eaſed of that yoak that is impoſed upon them, and furniſh themſelves with finer and leſs bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie Medicins, ſuch as may invite Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of the new and nobler way to employ them; which cannot be expected, till they have laid aſide the other Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For otherwiſe, neceſſity will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain Phyſicians to erect Laboratories, <pb n="435" facs="tcp:48729:236"/> and take to the making of ſuch Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within the compaſs of their own Houſes, as will better fit and furniſh them, for a finer and more delicate courſe of Practiſe. And if this Advice will not be hearkned to from me, they may do well to give ear to a learned and moſt inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Member of their own Profeſſion, I mean Monſieur <hi>Le Febure,</hi> the Kings Royal Profeſſor in Chymiſtry, and Apothecary in ordinary to the Houſhold, who having dedicated to his Majeſty the Book called <hi>A Complete Body of Chymiſtry,</hi> directs alſo an Epiſtle Entituled <hi>To the Apothecaries of England,</hi> wherein he tells them, <hi>that he hath, and alwaies ſhall have the ſame Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for them, as he hath had for his own Countrimen the French Apothecaries: That the end of his endeavors in his undertaking is, to advance the dignity of</hi> Pharmacy, that is to ſay, <hi>the Art of the Apothecary, which now lies bending toward its ruine, if it be not upheld by its true Arches and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, the faithful learned experienced and curious Phyſicians;</hi> and that you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he doth not mean the <hi>Galenick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi> he names thoſe notable Chymiſts of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, <hi>Doctor Duhan,</hi> late publick Profeſſor at <hi>Sedan,</hi> Doctor <hi>Clos</hi> of <pb n="436" facs="tcp:48729:237"/>

<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Chymical Foundation:</hi> For a little after he ſaith,
<hi>He gives nothing in his Book to the Apothecaries but what he firſt received from the Phyſicians, ſo that it is to them only that they owe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.</hi> And he invites the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to a falling to a more true and legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <hi>courſe of Preparation than formerly,</hi> as the only means to attain better Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Compoſitions; and tells them, <hi>that he hath undertaken this labor for their ſakes, becauſe he never yet found one that hath taken the pains or care, to ſhew and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover punctually the manner of operating upon things to preſerve their vertue and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their defaults; and that they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the difference there is in the correction of thoſe Medicaments which are made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
                  <pb n="437" facs="tcp:48729:237"/> 
                  <hi>to the opinions and directions of antient</hi> Pharmacie, <hi>with that which is directed and commanded by the Modern,</hi> viz. <hi>the Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and that they may obſerve likewiſe the Envy and Malice of thoſe that carp at and rail against</hi> Chymiſtry, <hi>whilst they through ignorance exclaim, that this admirable Art is not employed by its followers, ſave only on Poyſons, whereas they will find Chymical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of</hi> Animals <hi>and</hi> Vegetables, <hi>as well as of other things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now other Apothecaries perceiving, not only by the words of this
<hi>Apothecarie Royal,</hi> but by the current of the ſtream of Practiſe running every day in other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and our own alſo, toward this new and more ſafe, as well as delicate way of preparation of Medicins, grounded upon a new and more certain Philoſophy than the <hi>Scholaſtick,</hi> muſt needs be at a great ſtand what to do; for, in regard that the pedantick
<hi>Galeniſts,</hi> and the <hi>Semi-Chymiſts</hi> of the Town, know not how to attempt a cure, but by preſcribing the old ſtuff, in purſuance of the old Dogmatical Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore the Apothecaries muſt have that ſtuff in readineſs, or elſe they loſe the benefit of that ſort of Practiſe: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the other hand, the later and more
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:48729:238"/> excellent Brood of Phyſicians do every day run under the Wings of <hi>Chymistry,</hi> and addict themſelves only to Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and more rational Learning, and to the inventing and uſing of more noble Medicaments than the Shops as yet afford, there is a neceſſity lying on theſe Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, for the good of their Country, as well their own honor and content in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of a good Conſcience, to decline the uſe of that old fulſom (and for the moſt part) unwholſom ſtuff (the beſt of it being but dull languid, and of little effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to encounter the ſtrange
<hi>Hydraes</hi> of Diſeaſes in this Age, or ſo much as to reach them in their lurking Dens and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres of reſidence or retirement) and ſo not finding in the Shops what is agreeable to the new, they inſtead of ſending Bils thither (as the faſhion is) are conſtrained either to make Preparations in their own Houſes, or elſe borrow and buy of one another what they know to be right and fit for their purpoſe<hi>:</hi> by which means moſt of the Apothecaries are ſtrangers to them, and loſe the greateſt part of advantage, which otherwiſe might accrue to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety by this new and nobler way of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. What remains then for remedy
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:48729:238"/> and ſupport to ſo worthy a Society as the Apothecaries, but that they ſhould for preſent maintenance be indulged to make uſe of their own Medicins, at their own Diſcretion, among the Sick, ſeeing the prudent part of them underſtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them, and the old road of practiſe belonging to them, as well as (if not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than) the
<hi>Galeniſts?</hi> For, unleſs nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Families be impoveriſhed, there ſeems to be a kind of neceſſity of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, till the old
<hi>Galenick Formalities</hi> be reformed, or laid to ſleep, and a more uſeful ſtate of <hi>Pharmacie,</hi> and of <hi>Phyſical learning,</hi> can by degrees be admitted and ſettled in their place, that ſo the Shops and the Phyſicians may mutually correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond again, and flouriſh in due time, by being eſtabliſhed upon more ſure Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and upon a more rational courſe of Practiſe, than ever can be attained to by a purſuance of the old <hi>Scholaſtick Precepts, Methods</hi> and <hi>Medicins;</hi> which appear eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year more fruitleſs and Worm-eaten than formerly, and a very few years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience more will give them a Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
               <p>

<hi>Fernelius</hi> in this, as in many other things, who though he died a
<hi>Galeniſt,</hi> it muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the time wherein he lived, rather than his own default; for, though the noble Art of Chymical Experimental Philoſophy and Phyſick lay then very much in the dark, yet the notable brain of that man had formed to himſelf many more ſublime Notions touching Nature and her operations, than the common <hi>Crambe</hi> of the Schools afforded; as may be ſeen by that refined Piece of his <hi>De Abditis Rerum Cauſis, concerning the hidden Cauſes of Things;</hi> which whoever reads will find he had ſo much good Philoſophy in his head, as had he lived in this Age to ſee what we ſee, would quickly have brought him off to an imbracement of the profeſſion of <hi>Chymical Phyſick.</hi> For, he ſaw well enough, that Diſeaſes in his daies began to alter, and gives us to underſtand, that if there be an Alteration of the ſtate of them, it muſt be alſo in the ſtate of <hi>Medicin.</hi>

               <p>Certainly then, it is high time to look towards other Principles to direct us in the inventing of Medicins proper for the Age wherein we live; nor are we to look only to Principles, and the ſtate of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:48729:248"/> in this Age, but we are alſo to have regard to the Climate, and Country where we live, if in the framing of Medicins we will fit them right for the purpoſe to which we intend them; for, what will cure in one Climate or Country, may either kill, or make the Sick much worſe in another Country, there being a kind of <hi>Craſis</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or nature in one ſoil, and under one Sky, both as to Men and Things, which is different from thoſe in other parts even of the ſame Country, much more in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter parts of the world; and therefore I do not ſee how we can, even for this cauſe, conceive that Medicaments, and Methods of uſing them, borrowed from <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> and other Quarters of the earth, can with reaſon be relied on, with ſo much Authority and confidence, as our
<hi>ruling Galeniſts</hi> would perſwade us at this day. I remember what prudent <hi>Celſus</hi> ſaith

Indeed tis a wonder to ſee, how a few Authors of one or two particular Countries, have, through the ignorance of mankind, for many Ages, impoſed Medicins, as of univerſal uſe for all the world.</p>
               <p>By Domeſtick Medicins, I mean not ſuch only as are growing at home in our own Fields and Gardens, but ſuch Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Medicins alſo as are fitted to that which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Idioſyncraſia</hi> the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Temper of our Bodies as we are <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and to the condition of the Diſeaſes of our Country, there being as great a difference in the proprieties of the Diſeaſes of diſtinct Countries, as there is in the Natures of the people. It were to be wiſhed, that Simples of the growth of our own Country were more uſed, and the knowledge of their Vertues better improved; and then certainly much more might be effected by them than yet we ſee; eſpecially, were our Diet and Drinks more Simple and leſs Luxurious, and people more temperate, doubtleſs <hi>mere Simples</hi> might be of much more efficacy, becauſe <pb n="462" facs="tcp:48729:250"/> our Diſeaſes would be more
<hi>Simple,</hi> and much leſs <hi>Complicate</hi> than they are ſeen to be. But ſeeing we live in an Age, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is a conjunction of numerous Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uries, which men acquaint their Bodies with in their manner of living, there is no relying upon <hi>Simples</hi> in the greater Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; but there is a neceſſity of uſing Art to the utmoſt, till there be a more Temperate world; and all I contend for is, that in making uſe of Artificial Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, we ſhould not rely upon devices of Foreiners, nor ſuffer them to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon us (as they have been of old to this day) as the only things to be reſted on in caſe of Sickneſs, and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count up-held by Phyſicians for common uſe unto the People: but when we have occaſion to make uſe of Medicins, the only way is to ſeek out ſuch as are by our own Countrimen deviſed, with a regard to the peculiar condition of Nature in our own people, and to the alter'd ſtate of Diſeaſes among us.

<hi>ſince they reaſon only by the Principles and Organs of</hi> Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Philoſophy. <hi>Let us then conclude in the behalf of</hi> Chymical Remedies,
<hi>and ſay, that they are the true weapons wherewith a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an muſt arm himſelf, to conquer and extirpate the most ſtubborn and rebellious Diſeaſes, even ſuch as are held incurable by the ordinary Remedies of</hi> Galenical <hi>Phyſick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet for all this, the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> will not part with their old <hi>Scholaſtick Methods</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> though many of them come <pb n="472" facs="tcp:48729:255"/> off ſo farr as to make uſe of ſome of the ordinary <hi>Chymical Remedies,</hi> which prove the leſs effectual, becauſe the uſe of them requires other Notions to manage them with advantage, even when they are beſt prepared. But that which is moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, and which brings a ſcandal upon Chymical Medicaments, as well as grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance many times to Patients, is, that the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> venturing to uſe them as they find them in the Shops, do too often light upon unlucky Preparations, ſuch as are <hi>Crem Tartari</hi> adulterated with
<hi>Alum; Calomelanos,</hi> the <hi>Emetick Powder</hi> called <hi>Merc. Vitae,</hi> and divers other Medicaments, which being made beyond-Sea by halves, or unskilfully, are bought at low rates, and brought in many times by
<hi>Druggiſts</hi> and others trading in ſuch Commodities, of whom Country-Practitioners and ſome Apothecaries do buy them, or elſe of mean Mercenary and unskilful perſons who live in Corners, and venture upon the making of theſe edged Tools at lower rates than others; whereas the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and ingenious ſort of Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do, and the reſt ought to make them carefully with their own hands, and to ſeek an amendment of thoſe Preparations: <pb n="473" facs="tcp:48729:255"/> but in the mean while, the
<hi>fine fingred Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniſt,</hi> whoſe fair hand is made only for feeling of <hi>Pulſes,</hi> and ſo dares not fully them by raking in Cinders, leaves the validity of thoſe Medicaments to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of others, and ſo the Patient is left to a miſerable hazard; for, put caſe that one of the
<hi>Ambulatory Doctors</hi> hath occaſion to write Bils for ſeveral Patients in a day, and in them hath occaſion to preſcribe thoſe or the like operative Chymical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which are in common uſe, perhaps the Patients live at ſeveral Ends of the Town, and ſo uſually the Bils are ſent to ſeveral Apothecaries, whom perhaps the Doctor never ſaw, much leſs knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be honeſt careful men, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe their Medicaments be rightly prepared, what aſſurance can there be for the poor Patients? or what recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence be made them, if miſchief be done by ſuch a careleſs way of Practiſe?</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is another error in practiſe, that in the moſt urgent and important Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, when a Patient is upon the Vertical Point of life or death, as in extreme Caſe of <hi>Fevers,</hi> and the like, the
<hi>common Road-Practiſer</hi> is not furniſhed with ſome noble Remedies of his own, to interpoſe at ſuch <pb n="474" facs="tcp:48729:256"/> Critical Minutes, upon the efficacy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he might of his own knowledge ſurely rely, rather than leave the Patient to the cure of the Common-Cordials of the Shops, which (if they were of any power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful efficacy in their own nature, yet) do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly differ in force and goodneſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the various Preparations in the honeſt or diſhoneſt, skilful or unskilful, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent or careleſs hands through which they paſs; yet <hi>Maſter Doctors</hi> Bils go to every Shop alike; that is, the Patient is ventured upon the reputation of any Shop he pleaſe to chuſe, or which the Doctor may commend, whereas in ſuch Caſes of extremity he ſhould think it the beſt way to truſt none but himſelf, and relie upon no remedies but his own, which every good and knowing Phyſician ought, in diſcharge of conſcience, to have in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon occaſion, ſeeing the leaſt exceſs, or defect in the nature of a Medicin, may at ſuch a time, being relied on, be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Sick.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that the leſs literate and more Emperical Practiſers, do oftentimes perform Cures in deſperate Caſes, when the Medicins preſcribed by the learned Bils will do no good; the Reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <pb n="475" facs="tcp:48729:256"/> I cannot ſo readily aſcribe to any thing elſe, as to this, that they are (for the moſt part) Maſters of good Specificks of their own Preparation, to encounter Diſeaſes in the moſt difficult plunging Caſes, whoſe vertues they are ſure of, &amp; know that they may reſt upon the uſe of them with ſafety.

               <p>To this I anſwer, that perhaps they may; but let me add alſo, that the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Diſeaſes themſelves, according to the deſcription which I have made of its Cauſes in this Treatiſe, is that which cries aloud for an alteration, not only of <pb n="482" facs="tcp:48729:260"/> the old Method, but of the ſtate and compoſure of Medicaments alſo. As for the
<hi>Method,</hi> it was never of a greater height of reputation, than in the days of <hi>Fernelius;</hi> and yet that excellent wit was not ſatisfied with it, but ſaw the vanity of it, and yet could not find in his heart to ſpeak otherwiſe than tenderly againſt it; I cannot remember the Chapter where, but can recite the words, and they are theſe, <hi>Qui Methodum, ſcilicet Scholaſticam, in omnibus nimiùm pertinaciter exquirit, pariter cum Morbo hominem de Medio tollit:</hi> which is, <hi>that he who in all points too per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciouſly inſists upon the Scholastick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, doth together with the Diſeaſe remove the man out of the world.</hi> And if he in his days ſaw there was a neceſſity of being looſe from it, is it not a miſerable thing to ſee, that men learned, and of reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the world, ſhould tie themſelves (for the moſt part) to it in this new ſtate of Diſeaſes? I remember, <hi>Oſwald Grembs</hi> doth tax them for it tartly, in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of his ſecond Book, that though they make uſe often of
<hi>Chymical Medicaments,</hi> yet they adminiſter them according to the
<hi>Galenick Method;</hi> but though in this (ſaith he) they would ſeem very Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical, <pb n="483" facs="tcp:48729:260"/> yet in truth <hi>they are no better than Empericks, while they give Chymical Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but are ignorant from what ground they have their operation; for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if they know not from what cauſe Spirit of</hi> Sulphur <hi>gives relief in Fevers, not becauſe tis cold, not becauſe tis hot, not becauſe it cuts and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuates, but becauſe it extinguiſheth the hot Fermenting</hi> Alkali,
<hi>which is the occaſional, internal, and continent Cauſe of Fevers, then they cannot be called truly Methodical Phyſicians, becauſe ignorance of the true cauſe renders them Empericks, and becauſe if they perform a Cure with thoſe Remedies, they know not why, or what they do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet truly, they are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, rather than derided in the uſe of them, becauſe though they be ignorant of the true Method of uſing Chymical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, in regard they are unacquainted with the Nature and Reaſons of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of them, yet much good may be done in the adminiſtring by their hands, foraſmuch as the excellency of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins doth very often produce a good effect, notwithſtanding a defect of Method in the application of them.

                  <hi>who are of ſo deſpondent, or rather partial an humor, that if a Chymical Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or Specifick, do not preſently perform the hoped for cure, though they find that even upon their diſadvantageous manner of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring it, it doth good, yet they will quickly deſiſt from the uſe of it: And becauſe it doth not do wonders, they will not ſcruple to affirm that they have tried it, and found it do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; whereas they are wont to continue their own Courſes of Phyſick without Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though it be uſually ſome weeks before the Patient find any good by them, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Patient is, by the tedious courſe of Phyſick he hath gone through, very little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, if not much impaired, as numbers of the Printed Obſervations, as well as daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, do teſtifie. Which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſpeak, not with an intention to diſparage Phyſicians in general, the moſt learned and ingenious of them being free enough from the partiality which I here take notice of, but to keep good Remedies from being diſparaged by the Envious or unskilful Trials of bad Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrers</hi> (as, ſay I, moſt of the Semi-Chymical Galeniſts uſe to be.) <hi>And though indeed ſome Chymiſts are ſo vain-glorious, or</hi>

                  <hi>unwary, as to promiſe, that the operation of their Remedies ſhall be as well ſudden, as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, yet if the Medicins themſelves be found available, although not ſwiftly ſo, that ſlowneſs ought to make us but condemn the Boaſtings of the man, not reject the uſe of the Remedies.

               <p>Another Trick of the Pedantick ſort of Galeniſts, and a very common one, is, that if Chymical Medicins be adminiſtred, though they be of the nobleſt, the ſafeſt, and beſt prepared ſort, and much more gentle and efficacious (as generally the meaneſt of them which have due Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are) than any they can pretend to out of the common ſtuff of the Shops, yet if the Patient prove not curable by them, but draws down to death, and if the Fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of death be, as in many Caſes they are, great Pains and other dire Symptoms, <pb n="492" facs="tcp:48729:265"/> then knowing that the more ignorant and fearful ſort of people are, even by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or ignorance of ſuch Phyſicians, as well as by their own Phantſies, made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate againſt the name of Chymiſtry, thoſe Phyſicians craftily take occaſion from thence to work upon peoples weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and buz into their ears that thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive Conflicts of Nature and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe are cauſed by the Chymical Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, than which (I ſay) rightly prepared, there are not ſafer Remedies in the world. Upon this account it is, and by ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Inſinuations (which are the Arts they have leiſure to ſtudy, and little elſe to do, becauſe all their Do lies in a Pen and Ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn and a <hi>Recipe)</hi> that they hold ſome part of the people in bondage to this day, though the greateſt part are by time and obſervation grown too wiſe now to be bug-bear'd by them any longer. When
<hi>Chymiſtry</hi> firſt began to open the eyes of the world, Oh then there was nothing but Fire and Fagot againſt it, becauſe the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenick Maſters</hi> were diſturbed by the Lift that it gave to old Ignorance and Error; whole Colleges began to ring againſt it as a new Art of poyſoning the world, yea and no leſs than an Invention of the Devil,
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:48729:265"/> as the many Books they then ſet forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, do ſhew, and among the reſt, none is more fierce than that which was publiſhed by the College of <hi>Paris</hi> againſt Sir <hi>Theodore Mayern</hi> and the famous <hi>Quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetan;</hi> and the numerous bitter railing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives contained therein againſt Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Remedies, I might here inſert, were they not too tedious. Let it ſuffice to know, that they railed againſt things they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as little as ſome of ours do at this day, being ſuch Remedies as made thoſe two perſons men famous in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all over <hi>Europe,</hi> and yet Galenick Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Envy was ſo bold, as to condemn them by publike ſentence (touching which you have had an account in the firſt <hi>Chap.</hi> of this <hi>Treatiſe)</hi> and not only them, but <hi>the whole Art of Chymiſtry it ſelf.</hi> And yet it was not long after, that theſe angry men the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> began to cool a little in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the harmleſs and noble effects of ſome of the Medicins, the meaneſt of which they ſaw were able to effect greater Feats in curing, than the beſt of their old ones; ſo that after they had grumbled and gazed and repin'd and paus'd a while, they began to venture to uſe ſome of the more common ſort of them. Oh, what, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
                  <pb n="494" facs="tcp:48729:266"/> and <hi>Antimony!</hi> they were not once to be touched ſo much as with a pair of Tongs: But at length they did venture both upon
<hi>Mercurial</hi> and <hi>Antimonial</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations (to their praiſe be it ſpoken) and theſe they are even to this day ſo fix't upon (I mean the more common prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they have ſetled the uſe of in the Shops) that moſt of them reſt there, and care not to budge an inch from them, to buſy themſelves either in Meliorating them, or inventing higher and nobler Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments of that kind; nor doe ſome of them willingly afford a good thought or word for any that are invented, or that are put upon improvement and advance by the induſtry of the more laborious <hi>Chymical Phyſicians;</hi> to whom (next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God) this new Age of Diſeaſes is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden for their Cures in moſt of the Chronick and moſt obſtinate Caſes; as every days experience doth now abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly manifeſt.</p>
               <p>And therefore that advice of Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> falls in very pat here, when he tells us,

<hi>Herbaliſts</hi> have but written after <pb n="501" facs="tcp:48729:269"/> his copy, and tranſcribed out of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Books; and the <hi>Galenick Maſters</hi> (have for the moſt part) conſidered only the outſide qualities of <hi>hot, cold, moiſt, dry,</hi> &amp;c. and by eſtimate of theſe endeavoured to pry into their Natures, ſo that they ſtill reſt in the <hi>dark Chaos</hi> of unknown vertues, or <hi>hidden Qualities;</hi> whereas if they would take that Bunch of Keys, the ſublimer Notions of the Principles of Chymical Philoſophy, and uſe them, they might even by common little wayes of Operation and Experiment, unlock the <hi>Simples,</hi> and look into the more eſſential part of their Natures; for even <hi>Vegetables</hi> may come to be underſtood this way, as well as the parts or Principles of Minerals come to be Analyſed and Apprehended by the help of Fire, and more elaborate operations.</p>
               <p>And truly, this courſe of handling <hi>Vegetables,</hi> I take to be every jot as <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical,</hi> as if they were examined only by Fire, like the Minerals, and ought to be Characterized by the name of <hi>Chymical Remedies,</hi> becauſe he who makes the inquiry to invent them, is guided therein by reaſoning according to the Principles <pb n="502" facs="tcp:48729:270"/> of the <hi>Chymists.</hi> Nevertheleſs, this is not ſaid to leſſen the repute of that good way of examining and improving <hi>Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> as well as <hi>Minerals,</hi> by the help of Fire and Furnaces; for nothing is more neceſſary than that helps in every way be made uſe of, for diſcovering the nature and vertues of all mixt Bodies; and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto we have been beholden (for the moſt part) to the fire for our diſcoveries, and are like to be; ſo that the hinting and offering of a new way of diſcovery can be no prejudice thereto, but all courſes ought to be taken to improve the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the vertues of Vegetables as well as Minerals, becauſe Vegetables are moſt for ordinary uſe, and when they will not doe, then Minerals are often of moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in the more deſperate and deplorable Diſeaſes. Therefore, tis a great miſtake in the common ſort of people to think, that <hi>Chymical Phyſicians</hi> deal only in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals;</hi> and that miſtake of theirs hath given occaſion to Scandalizers to work upon their Phantſies an averſation from the <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> whereas none deal more in <hi>Vegetables</hi> and parts of <hi>Animals</hi> than they do, for the making of Medicins; only <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>

                  <hi>Bile</hi> alſo hath, till <hi>Helmont</hi> opened the eyes of this Age, been thought an <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but now men begin to be of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that it is one of the nobleſt <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the Body, ſeparated from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial <pb n="508" facs="tcp:48729:273"/> blood, and ſerving for many uſes, and particularly ſubſerving to the motion of the Chyle, after it is paſſed from the Stomack to the Inteſtines, by promoting the Periſtaltick Motion of the Guts; and that the Chyle being a Subſtance impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with a <hi>Volatile Spirit,</hi> a <hi>Lixivious Salt,</hi> and an
<hi>acid Spirit,</hi> by the Fermental Action of the Stomack, becomes in the
<hi>Duodenum</hi> impregnated by a farr greater quantity of <hi>Lixivious Salt,</hi> and ſomewhat more of a <hi>Sulphur,</hi> or oyly nature, and of a
<hi>Volatile Spirit,</hi> than it had before, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to its further Proceſs in the <hi>Milky Veins</hi> and in the Heart, till it put on the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Form of Bloud; which <hi>Chymical Notions</hi> whoever is ignorant of, will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be able to underſtand the Nature of thoſe many Diſeaſes called <hi>Bilious,</hi> with other Diſtempers incident to the Stomack and Bowels, and conſequently be leſs able to apply ſuch Medicaments as may meet with them, according to the predominan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie or exorbitancie of either of thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ingredient either in the
<hi>Chyle,</hi> or in the <hi>Bile;</hi> from whence ariſe abundance of fretful and frightful Diſeaſes, eſpecially in Children. As for Inſtance, when the <pb n="509" facs="tcp:48729:273"/> Ferment of the Stomack, or the Bile, grown extravagant through the over acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Spirit, or through exceſs or adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of the Lixivious Salt, cauſeth <hi>Frets</hi> in Children, or Torments of Belly in el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der people, then the Galenick Medicins uſually given to lenifie, dulcifie, and alter the matter, and pacifie the Bowels, prove for the moſt ineffectual, whereas other Medicins adminiſtred by the hand of a Chymical Phyſician, which are ſevere in appearance, but having in them a power of ſtrangulating thoſe <hi>Saltineſſes</hi> and
<hi>Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> which cauſe the Diſtemper, do imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly put an end to it. After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner have I ſeen that ſevere corroſive Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor called Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> by addition of the Acid Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> or of the Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> loſe that Corroſive acidity which it had before. Not that I would have Oyls of <hi>Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Tartar</hi> uſed by any to do the like, in ſuch Caſes, within the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; but I mention the Experiment, only to illuſtrate my Diſcourſe, and convince the Reader, that a learned <hi>Chymical Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> who underſtands theſe things, and thereupon knows immediately, from ſure and rational Principles, how to form a <pb n="510" facs="tcp:48729:274"/> Medicin, is the man more ſurely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied on for Cure, than the common <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniſts,</hi> who reſt upon old Notions, and general Shop-Medicins; and are uſually ſtrangers to the Properties of things, as they are diſcoverable by the genuine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Operations of Nature. Thus thoſe <hi>Acidities</hi> abounding in <hi>Quartans</hi> are often cured by Liquefactions of
<hi>Sandivere,</hi> or of <hi>common Salt</hi> after its being calcined, a convenient number of Drops being duly exhibited in ſome proper Vehicle. And if thoſe <hi>Acidities</hi> or <hi>Acrimonies</hi> be dealt with by Medicaments abounding with a <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> they are immediatly lenifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<hi>:</hi> Juſt as <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> being cohoba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with
<hi>Spirit of Salt,</hi> they ſo attemper each other, that the one loſeth its Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, and the other its acrimonious Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
               <p>Thus in the many frequent Diſtempers, which ariſe from Ebullitions of ſharp and acid Liquors in Scorbutick Bodies, in which Caſes the <hi>common Galeniſts</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are for blouding to allay them, a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Chymical Phyſician,</hi> being Maſter of ſuch Medicaments, as have power imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to alter, pacifie, or precipitate
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:48729:274"/> thoſe Acrimonies and Acidities, performs the work, without any ſuch damageable diminution of Bloud, which is the grand Vehicle of vitality; and the draining of it in ſuch Caſes, brings the Bodies of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to ſuch a Paſs, that after once or twice relieving them by it, the moſt dangerous Conſequent is this, that when they fall ill again, they look for it, and (Cuſtom proving Another Nature) can have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief without it, till the habit of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being deſtroyed by <hi>Iterated Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> there remains no more place for the practiſe of that, or any other Remedie whatſoever.</p>
               <p>It is not above a Fortnight ſince, that a youth lying in a very Feveriſh ſtate, with an ill Cough, I perceiving it came from a
<hi>Wormatick Cauſe</hi> in the Bowels, order'd him a Cordial impregnated with ſuch <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaliſate Salts</hi> as might alter the matter, kill the Worms, and abate the Feveriſh Heat, all in one; which a certain Doctor being brought in by ſome of the Friends to view the ſick, having taſted, he ſaid there was ſtrong water in it, and 'twas too Hot, and ſharp, and no more to be uſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe little conſidering the
<hi>Worms</hi> in the Caſe, <pb n="512" facs="tcp:48729:275"/> and that when that Cauſe was removed, the Fever and Cough would end of it ſelf, he concluded from the heat it was a <hi>Hectick Fever,</hi> and ſo ought to be plied with
<hi>cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pectorals;</hi> but the Boy two or three daies after, avoiding a
<hi>Worm,</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered, without more ado. I had not mentioned this, but to ſhew, how apt ſuch Phyſicians, though otherwiſe learned, are to be miſtaken by the outward conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>Hot</hi> and
<hi>Sharp,</hi> and other <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second Qualities,</hi> when they go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ground a Judgement concerning the nature either of Diſeaſes, or Medicins.</p>
